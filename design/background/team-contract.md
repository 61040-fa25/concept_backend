# Team Contract
Group Members: Madalina, Annabelle, Kali, Yahir (MAKY!)

## Goals
### What grades do you expect to get?
Ideally, we are all striving for an A. At the bare minimum, we expect to receive passing marks on all of the assignments. 

### How much time do you plan to put in?
Given that the group project is the focus of the class from this point onward, team members understand that at least 15 hours a week should be going to the group project each week.

### Personal goals for each team member (building a great app? learning a particular skill?)
- Yahir: huge personal passion in music tech, continue to expand skillset within that domain
- Annabelle: gain more confidence building out a complex repo
- Madalina: good infrastructure, good style throughout
- Kali: make a cool functioning app that is ideally useful as well

## Structuring our Work
### Frequency, length and location of team meetings

- Frequency: 2x a week\
- Location: 1x zoom, 1x person\
- Length: 30min-1hr\

Ideally, we’d come to the meetings prepared to talk about next steps or problems, which is why we want to make them streamlined but twice a week. 

### How quality of work will be maintained 
In group meetings, members will check in with one another on the status of their code and problems they’ve encountered. During these meetings, subsets of the group may also plan for times to pair program, especially when encountering particular problems or working on connected parts of the project.

### How tasks will be assigned, and what to do if deadlines are missed
We have a couple thoughts as to assigning tasks throughout the process of the project:
- Concept Modularity can help us to divide work initially
- If tasks seem more complex or are interleaved, we can pair up for more collaborations
- Migrating work & syncs could be done together
We will set internal deadlines and try to uphold each other on that. The biweekly (2x) meetings will help with accountability. If someone is really going through it, we can help each other, of course. 
### How decisions will be made and any disagreements resolved.
We will strive to rely on unanimous agreement on decisions so all members are on the same page. As a group, we are open to exploring different perspectives and compromising, but ideally, we hope to resolve any disagreements by picking the idea that is more efficient to integrate.
