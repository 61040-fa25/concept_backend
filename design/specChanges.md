# Website Changes
There are multiple changes I have made since Assignment 2.  My biggest issue from Assignment 2 was that my main feature might not be feasible in the timeframe that we have.  I wanted to add real-time collaboration (with handwritten notes).  However, trying to interpret handwriting can take up a lot of credits when using AI, and real-time collaboration is difficult to do. Thus, I've removed the shared-notes concept, and am adding an AI tutor feature which is a little easier to implement.  The notes are also no longer handwritten, and instead typed which is more feasible and less expensive.

My main feature will now be a tagging feature which allows students to tag lectures based on how urgent it is to come back to.  This makes it simpler to review notes and visually reminds students to come back to the sections that confused them the most (helps students from pushing back studying to the last minute). The website will also have an folder feature to organize notes.  Finally, it will have a feature which will test your knowledge with questions based on your notes (ie an AI tutor).  Perhaps some syncs can also automatically tag certain sections based on how well you do on the questions that the AI tutor gives you.

The problem that this app is trying to solve is still retaining material presented at lecture.
