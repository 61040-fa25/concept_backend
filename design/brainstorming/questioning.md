# prompt: Why is ?
# response:

Please complete your question! I need to know *what* you're asking about.

For example, you could ask:

*   "Why is the sky blue?"
*   "Why is exercise important?"
*   "Why is the internet so slow today?"
*   "Why is that country in the news?"

Once you tell me what "is," I'll do my best to explain!
