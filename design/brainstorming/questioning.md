# prompt: Why is the sky blue?
# response:

The sky is blue primarily due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1.  **Sunlight is White Light:** Sunlight, when it reaches Earth, appears white to us. However, it's actually composed of all the colors of the rainbow, each with a different wavelength. Violet and blue light have shorter, smaller wavelengths, while red and orange light have longer, larger wavelengths.

2.  **Earth's Atmosphere:** Our atmosphere is made up of a mixture of gases, primarily nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%), along with other trace gases and particles.

3.  **Rayleigh Scattering:**
    *   When sunlight enters the atmosphere, it collides with these tiny gas molecules.
    *   These molecules are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light.
    *   According to Rayleigh scattering, shorter wavelengths of light (like blue and violet) are scattered much more efficiently and intensely by these small particles than longer wavelengths (like red and yellow). Think of it like a tiny obstacle bouncing smaller things around more easily than larger things.
    *   In fact, blue light is scattered about 10 times more effectively than red light.

4.  **Why Blue, Not Violet?**
    *   While violet light is scattered even *more* than blue light, the sky appears blue for two main reasons:
