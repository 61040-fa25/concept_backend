This document provides a detailed specification for defining "concepts," which are a structured way to describe system functionalities and their underlying data models.

It outlines a specific structure for each concept specification, comprising the following sections:

1.  **Concept**: The name of the concept and any generic type parameters it uses.
2.  **Purpose**: The user-need focused, specific, and evaluable reason for the concept's existence.
3.  **Principle**: An archetypal, goal-focused, differentiating, and essential scenario demonstrating how the concept fulfills its purpose.
4.  **State**: A data model representing what the concept remembers, emphasizing separation of concerns and different "views" of entities.
5.  **Actions**: A set of operations, specified in pre/post conditions, that modify the state. These can be user actions or system actions, and preconditions are treated as firing conditions.
6.  **Queries**: (Often implicit) operations for reading the concept state, with explicit definitions for non-trivial observations.

The document also highlights key distinctions, particularly that "concepts are not objects" in the traditional object-oriented sense, emphasizing their focus on encapsulating a complete behavioral concern rather than individual object properties.

In essence, it's a guide for a formal, behavior-centric approach to system design and specification.
