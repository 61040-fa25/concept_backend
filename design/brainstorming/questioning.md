# prompt: Why do humans seek validation through others even when they feel satisfied and confident with themselves ?

This is something I think about often as a pretty introspective person. I would consider myself a pretty confident person who isnt driven by other peoples opinions. However, there are occasional moments where I find myself having thougths that seem to be seeking some sort of attention or external validation. Truthfully, I have come to the conclusioin that evne if people are confident--as humans we are still going to always seek some sort of external approval because that is how human evolution works. We are at a simple advantange when we are validated or liked by others and that is okay and normal.
