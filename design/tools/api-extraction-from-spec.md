# Concept API extraction

You are an expert software architect tasked with generating clear, developer-friendly API documentation. Your input is a formal "Concept Specification" which describes a modular piece of software functionality. This concept has been implemented and exposed as a REST-like API by a "Concept Server."

Your mission is to translate the provided Concept Specification into a structured API specification document written in Markdown. This document will be used by frontend developers to interact with the API.

Adhere to the following rules for the API structure and the documentation format:

**API Structure Rules:**

1.  **Base URL:** Assume a base URL of `/api`.
2.  **Endpoint Naming:** Each concept action or query maps to an endpoint. The URL structure is: `/{conceptName}/{actionOrQueryName}`.
    *   For a concept named `Labeling` and an action `createLabel`, the endpoint is `/api/Labeling/createLabel`.
3.  **HTTP Method:** All endpoints use the `POST` method.
4.  **Data Format:** All requests and responses use the `application/json` content type.
5.  **Request Body:** The request body is always a single JSON object. The keys of this object correspond to the input arguments defined in the action's signature.
6.  **Response Body:**
    *   **Actions:** A successful call to an action returns a single JSON object. The keys correspond to the results defined in the action's signature. If there are no results, an empty object `{}` is returned.
    *   **Queries:** A successful call to a query (a method name starting with `_`) returns a JSON **array** of objects.
    *   **Errors:** If an action fails to meet its `requires` condition or encounters another error, it returns a single JSON object with a single key: `{ "error": "A descriptive error message." }`.

**Documentation Format Rules:**

Generate the output in Markdown using the following template. For each action and query in the specification, create a dedicated endpoint section.

# prompt: Now for the following concept spec
# TripCostEstimation

## Purpose

Generate realistic cost estimates based on trip details, using AI for data retrieval and calculation.

## Principle

Based on a user's choice of initial departure city and arrival city, and the user's sheltering accommodations and food location preferences, an estimate is provided; the LLM is used to search for and calculate median cost ranges based on the provided necessities.

## State

*   A set of `Users` with
    *   A set of `TravelPlans`
*   A set of `Locations` with
    *   A `city` String
*   A set of `TravelPlans` with
    *   A `fromCity` Location
    *   A `toCity` Location
    *   A `fromDate` Date
    *   A `toDate` Date
    *   A `necessity` Necessity
    *  A LatestUpdatedCostEstimate CostEstimate
*   A set of `Necessities` with
    *   An `accommodation` Boolean // true for saving for rooms, false for not
    *   A `diningFlag` Boolean // true for saving for eating out, false for not
*   A set of `CostEstimates` with
    *   A `travelPlanID` String
    *   A `flight` Number // estimated total round-trip flight cost in USD
    *   A `roomsPerNight` Number // estimated cost per night in USD
    *   A `foodDaily` Number // estimated cost per day in USD
    *   A `lastUpdated` Date // tracking when the estimate was generated

## Actions

*   `createTravelPlan(user: User, fromCity: Location, toCity: Location, fromDate: Date, toDate: Date): (travelPlan: TravelPlan)`
    *   **Requires:** `fromCity` and `toCity` exists and `toDate` >= `fromDate` and both are greater than the current date
    *   **Effect:** Create and return a `travelPlan` with a `fromCity`, `toCity`, and from and to dates, and a default necessity (`accommodation` = true, `diningFlag` = true)

*   `deleteTravelPlan(user: User, travelPlan: TravelPlan):  (travelPlan: TravelPlan)`
    *   **Requires:** `travelPlan` exists and belongs to user
    *   **Effect:** Delete the `travelPlan` and any associated `CostEstimates`

*   `updateNecessity(user: User, travelPlan: TravelPlan, accommodation: Boolean, diningFlag: Boolean): (travelPlan: TravelPlan, necessity: Necessity)`
    *   **Requires:** `travelPlan` exists and belongs to user, `accommodation` exists as one of the livingSpaces and `diningFlag` indicates whether the user plans to save for eating out (true) or not (false)
    *   **Effect:** Create and add the `necessity` with `accommodation` and `diningFlag` to `travelPlan`

*   `resetNecessity(user: User, travelPlan: TravelPlan): (necessity: Necessity)`
    *   **Requires:** `travelPlan` exists and belongs to user
    *   **Effect:** Reset the `necessity` belonging to `travelPlan` to the default as described in the action `createTravelPlan`

*   **async** `generateAICostEstimate(user: User, travelPlan: TravelPlan, llm: GeminiLLM): (costEstimate: CostEstimate)`
    *   **Requires:** `travelPlan` exists and belongs to user
    *   **Effect:** Retrieves trip details (dates, locations) and necessity preference (accommodation, dining) and uses the llm's specialized tool (e.g., Google Search/Flights/Hotels) to calculate and return the median cost estimates for flight, `rooms_per_night`, and `food_daily`; the resulting data is stored as a new `CostEstimate` associated with the `travelPlanID. Also, add the most recent CostEstimate to travelPlan` 
    *   **Note:** The LLM prompt will be specifically tailored to search for accommodation prices matching the `accommodation` Boolean (e.g., true for hotel/motel costs) and food costs based on the `diningFlag` (true for "restaurant costs," false for "no food costs"). If the LLM fails to provide an estimate for any reason or the costs are widely inaccurate (less than 50, more than 100000 for example) then the user can manually enter the total cost of the trip that they plan to save for.

*   `estimateCost (user: User, travelPlan: TravelPlan): (totalCost: Number)`
    *   **Requires:** `travelPlan` exists and belongs to user and an associated `CostEstimate` exists
    *   **Effect:** Calculates and returns the `totalCost` by multiplying the estimated daily/nightly costs by the duration and adding the flight cost.

* `_getAllTravelPlans(user: User): (travelPlans: TravelPlan[])`
	  *  **Requires:** `user` exists
	  *  **Effect:** Returns a list of all `TravelPlans` associated with the given `user`.
