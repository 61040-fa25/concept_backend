#Academica User Journey

A Wellesley student is preparing for registration and feels overwhelmed by the large number of courses available. They open Academica and register. On the home page, they create a new schedule called "Fall 2025".

They navigate to the filter drop down next to the search bar and select “Bio” for the department and afternoon for the time of day. The app displays a filtered list of courses, reducing the overwhelming set to a manageable number relevant to their major and time preference.

The student adds a class to their schedule and click on it to view the professor’s rating and any distribution requirements it satisfies. They then repeat the process to add five more courses. After reviewing their schedule, they remove two courses, leaving a full load of four.

They duplicate their schedule to create "Fall 2025 Copy" as a back up. They click on the Ai suggestions button and select a course on their schedule to get similar alternatives. They add two of the three alternatives to their schedule and remove two courses for a a full load of four courses.

Finally, they export their first schedule to their Google Calendar, where they can view class names and times. The student feels relieved: they planned their schedule quickly, efficiently, and now have an easy reference for the semester.
