# Thoughts while working on the assignment

- Where the heck is everything? "a specification file (in markdown, using our structured specification notation);" WHERE IS THE STRUCTURED SPECIFICATION NOTATION???
	- Answer: There is an [example in Assignment-3](design/background/examples/specification-notation)
- Wow, it's going to take forever to manually `ctx save` every single file I may want to mention
- I feel like I'm spending a lot of overhead time just trying to figure out a good workflow to use the ctx tool
- Working on the Profile concept, if the implementation is just meant to be a transliteration of the concept, how should security be represented? Do I need to actually think through the principles of basic cybersecurity, salting and hashing, etc, or is the abstraction of "User with a username and password" good enough?
- IDEA: could add email to Profile concept, would be useful for resetting password
