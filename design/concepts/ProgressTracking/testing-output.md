--- Principle Test: Create, Add, Modify, Reach Goal, Remove, Delete ---
Principle: A plan breaks a trip‚Äôs cost into manageable contributions, the user sets a payment period and the amount to be paid every period. The user can also change those details for some trip.

Action: createPlan (user: 0199ed80, trip: 0199ed80, period: 12, amountPer: 100, goal: 1200)
Effect: New plan created with ID: 0199ed80, with initial period 12, amount 100
Query: updateGoalStatus -> Verified initial goalReachedFlag: false

Action: addAmount (user: 0199ed80, plan: 0199ed80, amount: 300)
Effect: Amount $300 added to plan, new currentAmount: 300
Query: updateGoalStatus -> Verified goalReachedFlag is false.

Action: modifyPlan (user: 0199ed80, plan: 0199ed80, newPeriod: 6, newAmountPer: 200)
Effect: Plan payment details changed. (Cannot query paymentPeriod/amountPerPeriod directly via _getPlans, as it only returns IDs).

Action: addAmount (user: 0199ed80, plan: 0199ed80, amount: 900)
Effect: Added $900 to reach goal, new currentAmount: 1200

\--- üöÄ Principle Test: Create, Add, Modify, Reach Goal, Remove, Delete ---
Principle: A plan breaks a trip‚Äôs cost into manageable contributions, the user sets a payment period and the amount to be paid every period. The user can also change those details for some trip.
