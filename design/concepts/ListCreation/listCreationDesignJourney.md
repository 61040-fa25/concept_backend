# List Creation - Design Journey
The first change I needed to make was to bound a User characteristic to each list. This was relatively simple but added some additional requirements to all actions of the concept design. Namely, I had been conceptualizing the process for a single user, so I had to introduce an 'owner' User for all lists. This also required recording the User who was performing each action type and requiring that the acting User and owner were the same. This ensures that only a given User can create or modify their own lists. This aligns with how I had been mentally approaching the problem, but brought my thought process up to the necessary scope.
