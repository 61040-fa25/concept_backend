## API Endpoints

### POST /api/Reaction/add

**Description:** Adds a new emoji reaction by a user to a specific post.

**Requirements:**
- reactionType IS_VALID_EMOJI (Note: In the current implementation, any string is treated as a valid EmojiString.)
- User cannot add the exact same emoji reaction to the same post twice.

**Effects:**
- create new_reaction with id = UUID(), post = post, reactionType = reactionType, reactingUser = reactingUser
- add new_reaction to Reaction
- returns new_reaction.id as 'reactionId'

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "post": "ID",
  "reactionType": "string",
  "reactingUser": "ID"
}
```

**Success Response Body (Action):**
```json
{
  "reactionId": "ID"
}
```

**Error Response Body:**
```json
{
  "error": "string"
}
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "post": "ID",
  "reactionType": "string",
