# test: Notes
# response:

Here's the test file for the `NotesConcept`, adhering to the provided guidelines for structure, testing steps, and database interaction.

First, let's ensure the `GeminiLLM` class is importable for the mock. Assuming it's a class with an `executeLLM` method, we can monkey-patch it for testing purposes.

**File: `src/Notes/NotesConcept.ts`** (No changes requested, but including for context of the `GeminiLLM` import)
```typescript

      You are a focused flashcard generator for Torah study.
      Input: a block of notes about any Torah topic.
      Output: valid JSON only â€” no commentary, no markdown, no extra text.

      CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
      1. Parse the notes and generate concise question/answer flashcards covering key rulings, definitions, reasons, stories, contrasts, disagreements(machlokes), ideas.
      2. Produce up to 25 cards depending on input length; if the notes are short, don't make up information not present in the notes to create more cards.
      3. IMPORTANT: If nothing is provided in the notes, do not create any cards.
      4. IMPORTANT: If insuffiecient information is provided, do not use any outside knowledge to create cards.
      5. Each card must have: id (integer starting at 1), question (string), answer (string).
      6. The top-level JSON must include only one key: "cards" (array).
      7. Do not include tags, timestamps, language markers, titles, or any other metadata.
      8. If an item in the notes is ambiguous or missing a clear answer, set the answer to "Ambiguous / not stated".
      9. Do not invent sources or facts not present in the notes.
      10. If the notes do not relate to Torah, return zero cards.
      11. Return parsable JSON only. Do not include any other text.

      Output format example (valid JSON only):
      { 
          "cards": [ 
              {
                  "id": <number starting at 1>, 
                  "question": <string Question text>, 
                  "answer": <string Answer text>
              }
              ... up to 25 cards ...
          ] 
      }

      Now process the input notes below and return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text.

# trace:

The principle for the `Notes` concept is:
"user can store notes or other textual information; the user can also remove notes; the user can also use an llm to turn notes into question/answer pairs (flashcards) based on the notes"

Here's a trace demonstrating how this principle is fulfilled:

1.  **Initial State**: The `NotesConcept` instance is initialized, and the database for notes is empty for `USER_ALICE`.

2.  **Action: `addNotes` (Store Notes)**
    *   **Call**: `notesConcept.addNotes({ user: USER_ALICE, name: "Talmud Basics", content: "The Talmud is a central text..." })`
    *   **Requires**: No existing note for `USER_ALICE` with name "Talmud Basics". (This is true, so the action proceeds).
    *   **Effects**: A new note document for `USER_ALICE` with name "Talmud Basics" and the provided content is inserted into the `notes` collection.
    *   **Assertion**: A subsequent `_getUserNotes({ user: USER_ALICE })` query would show "Talmud Basics" among Alice's notes.

3.  **Action: `notesToFlashCards` (Generate Flashcards)**
    *   **Setup**: The `GeminiLLM.prototype.executeLLM` method is temporarily mocked to return a predefined valid JSON string representing flashcards.
    *   **Call**: `notesConcept.notesToFlashCards({ user: USER_ALICE, name: "Talmud Basics" })`
    *   **Requires**: A note exists for `USER_ALICE` with name "Talmud Basics". (This is true from step 2, so the LLM interaction is simulated).
    *   **Effects**:
        *   The concept retrieves the content of "Talmud Basics" note.
        *   It constructs an LLM prompt using this content.
        *   It calls the (mocked) `GeminiLLM.executeLLM` which returns the predefined flashcard JSON.
        *   The concept parses this JSON into `Flashcard` objects.
        *   It returns an object `{ cards: [...] }` containing these flashcards.
    *   **Assertion**: The returned object contains an array of `Flashcard` objects derived from the mocked LLM response, verifying the parsing and return of the concept.

4.  **Action: `removeNotes` (Remove Notes)**
    *   **Call**: `notesConcept.removeNotes({ user: USER_ALICE, name: "Talmud Basics" })`
    *   **Requires**: A note exists for `USER_ALICE` with name "Talmud Basics". (This is true from step 2, so the action proceeds).
    *   **Effects**: The note document for `USER_ALICE` with name "Talmud Basics" is deleted from the `notes` collection.
    *   **Assertion**: A subsequent `_getUserNotes({ user: USER_ALICE })` query would *not* show "Talmud Basics" among Alice's notes, confirming its removal.

This sequence of actions (`addNotes`, `notesToFlashCards`, `removeNotes`) directly demonstrates all aspects of the concept's stated principle.

# response:

## Trace for "Principle: User can store notes, generate flashcards, and remove notes"

This trace describes the execution of the `Principle` test case from `src/Notes/NotesConcept.test.ts`, demonstrating how the `Notes` concept fulfills its stated purpose and principle: "user can store notes or other textual information; the user can also remove notes; the user can also use an llm to turn notes into question/answer pairs (flashcards) based on the notes".

**Initial State:**
The MongoDB database for the `NotesConcept` is clean and empty. `USER_ALICE` has no associated notes.

**1. Action: `addNotes` (Store Notes)**

*   **Call**: `notesConcept.addNotes({ user: USER_ALICE, name: NOTE_NAME_TALMUD, content: NOTE_CONTENT_TALMUD })`
*   **Input Arguments**:
    *   `user`: "user:Alice"
    *   `name`: "Talmud Basics"
    *   `content`: "The Talmud is a central text of Rabbinic Judaism. It is composed of two main parts: the Mishnah..."
*   **Requires (Precondition Check)**: The concept checks if a note with `name` "Talmud Basics" already exists for `user` "user:Alice". Since the database is initially empty, this condition is satisfied.
*   **Effects**:
    *   A new document is inserted into the `Notes.notes` collection.
    *   The document contains a unique `_id` (generated by `freshID()`), `user: "user:Alice"`, `name: "Talmud Basics"`, and the provided `content`.
*   **Verification**:
    *   The `addResult` is asserted to be `{}`, indicating successful completion without an error.
    *   `notesConcept._getUserNotes({ user: USER_ALICE })` is called. This query retrieves all notes for `USER_ALICE`.
    *   The result is asserted to be `[{ name: "Talmud Basics", content: NOTE_CONTENT_TALMUD }]`, confirming the note was successfully stored.

**2. Action: `notesToFlashCards` (Generate Flashcards)**

*   **Call**: `notesConcept.notesToFlashCards({ user: USER_ALICE, name: NOTE_NAME_TALMUD })`
*   **Input Arguments**:
    *   `user`: "user:Alice"
    *   `name`: "Talmud Basics"
*   **Requires (Precondition Check)**: The concept checks if a note with `name` "Talmud Basics" exists for `user` "user:Alice". This is true due to the `addNotes` call in the previous step.
*   **Effects**:
    *   The content of the "Talmud Basics" note (`NOTE_CONTENT_TALMUD`) is retrieved from the database.
    *   A prompt is constructed using this content, following the `createLLMPrompt` logic, and sent to the `GeminiLLM.executeLLM` method. **(Note**: In this final principle test, the LLM is *not* mocked, implying a real external call. The test assumes a successful, valid JSON response from the LLM based on the prompt.)
    *   The raw LLM response (expected to be JSON containing a `cards` array) is parsed by `parseLLMToFlashcards`.
    *   A list of `Flashcard` objects (each with `question` and `answer` properties) is returned.
*   **Verification**:
    *   `flashcardsResult` is asserted not to contain an `error` key.
    *   It's asserted that `flashcardsResult` has a `cards` property, and that this `cards` array is not empty.
    *   The generated flashcards (e.g., their questions and answers) are logged to the console, demonstrating the successful conversion of notes into study aids.

**3. Action: `removeNotes` (Remove Notes)**

*   **Call**: `notesConcept.removeNotes({ user: USER_ALICE, name: NOTE_NAME_TALMUD })`
*   **Input Arguments**:
    *   `user`: "user:Alice"
    *   `name`: "Talmud Basics"
*   **Requires (Precondition Check)**: The concept checks if a note with `name` "Talmud Basics" exists for `user` "user:Alice". This is true from the initial `addNotes` call.
*   **Effects**:
    *   The document corresponding to `user: "user:Alice"` and `name: "Talmud Basics"` is deleted from the `Notes.notes` collection.
*   **Verification**:
    *   The `removeResult` is asserted to be `{}`, indicating successful completion.
    *   `notesConcept._getUserNotes({ user: USER_ALICE })` is called again.
    *   The result is asserted to be `[]` (an empty array), confirming that the "Talmud Basics" note has been successfully removed from `USER_ALICE`'s collection.

**Final State:**
The `Notes.notes` collection is now empty of the "Talmud Basics" note for `USER_ALICE`, fulfilling the entire sequence described in the concept's principle.
