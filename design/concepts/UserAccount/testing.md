# test: UserAccount making sure you follow the assignment guidelines:

**Testing concepts**. Your tests should cover the basic behavior of the concept but should also include some more interesting cases. Your tests should use the Deno testing framework and should be programmatic (that is, determining in the code whether they succeeded or failed, and not requiring a human to interpret console messages). They should also print helpful messages to the console with action inputs and outputs so that a human reader can make sense of the test execution when it runs in the console. Some more details about the test cases you should include:

- **Operational principle**. A sequence of action executions that corresponds to the operational principle, representing the common expected usage of the concept. These sequence is not required to use all the actions; operational principles often do not include a deletion action, for example.
- **Interesting scenarios**. Sequences of action executions that correspond to less common cases: probing interesting corners of the functionality, undoing actions with deletions and cancellations, repeating actions with the same arguments, etc. In some of these scenarios actions may be expected to throw errors.
- **Number required**. For each concept, you should have one test sequence for the operational principle, and 3-5 additional interesting scenarios. Every action should be executed successfully in at least one of the scenarios.
- **No state setup**. Your test cases should not require any setting up of the concept state except by calling concept actions. When you are testing one action at a time, this means that you will want to order your actions carefully (for example, by the operational principle) to avoid having to set up state.
- **Saving test execution output**. Save the test execution output by copy-pasting from the console to a markdown file.

# Prompt: right now this consists of 5 steps. Isn't it better to make them 5 test cases?


# response:

That's an excellent question, and it highlights a common design choice in testing frameworks, especially with Deno's flexible `Deno.test` and `t.step` structure.

**Short Answer:** The current structure with a single `Deno.test` block containing multiple `t.step` blocks is **appropriate and even preferable** for concept testing, given the guidelines provided.

**Detailed Explanation:**

Let's break down the reasons based on the assignment guidelines:

1.  **"No state setup. Your test cases should not require any setting up of the concept state except by calling concept actions. When you are testing one action at a time, this means that you will want to order your actions carefully (for example, by the operational principle) to avoid having to set up state."**
    *   This is the most critical guideline here.
    *   If each `t.step` were converted into a separate `Deno.test` block, each `Deno.test` block would typically call `await testDb()` independently. This means each `Deno.test` would start with a **fresh, empty database**.
    *   For example, "Test 3: Profile Update and Verification" needs `registeredUser1` to exist. If it were a separate `Deno.test`, it would first have to call `register` and `login` *again* before it could test `updateProfile`. This is exactly the "setting up of the concept state" that the guideline wants to avoid (or minimize) by "ordering your actions carefully."
    *   By having one `Deno.test` block that calls `testDb()` once and then runs sequential `t.step`s, the state created in an earlier `t.step` (e.g., `registeredUser1` from `step 1`) is preserved and available for subsequent `t.step`s. This allows the tests to **build upon each other sequentially**, accurately mimicking a user's journey or a system's lifecycle where state persists between interactions.

2.  **"Operational principle. A sequence of action executions..." and "Interesting scenarios. Sequences of action executions..."**
    *   These guidelines describe *sequences* of actions. The `t.step` construct is perfect for defining these distinct sequences (the operational principle and 3-5 scenarios) while allowing them to run within a single, shared context if desired. Each `t.step` effectively serves as a logical "test case" or "scenario."

3.  **"Number required. For each concept, you should have one test sequence for the operational principle, and 3-5 additional interesting scenarios. Every action should be executed successfully in at least one of the scenarios."**
    *   The current structure fulfills this requirement directly: "Test 1" is the operational principle, and "Test 2" through "Test 5" are four additional interesting scenarios, totaling five. All actions (`register`, `login`, `updateProfile`, `deleteAccount`, `_getUserProfile`, `_findUserByEmail`) are executed successfully at least once across these steps.

**Why `t.step`s are good here:**

*   **Logical Grouping:** `t.step` allows you to group related assertions and actions into a single, cohesive logical test scenario.
*   **Sequential State:** It enables tests to build on shared state established in previous steps within the same overall test run, which aligns with the "no state setup" philosophy for complex interactions.
*   **Clear Output:** Deno's test runner reports `t.step`s clearly, showing which sub-scenario passed or failed, much like separate `Deno.test` blocks would.
*   **Efficiency:** Calling `testDb()` once for the entire concept's test run is generally more efficient than re-initializing the database for every single, smaller test.

**When separate `Deno.test` blocks are better:**

*   When each test needs to be **completely isolated** from every other test, starting from a pristine environment. This is often preferred for pure unit tests or when test ordering is truly irrelevant and side effects are strictly avoided.
*   When you want to run specific tests or groups of tests in parallel, as Deno can run top-level `Deno.test` blocks concurrently. (Though `t.step`s can also be run concurrently with `t.step({name: ..., fn: async () => {}, permissions: ..., sanitizeOps: ..., sanitizeResources: ...})` by omitting `await t.step` for the `t.step` calls themselves if they don't depend on each other, which isn't the case here).

**Conclusion:**

The current test file structure is well-suited to the concept design paradigm and the specific testing guidelines. It demonstrates how actions build upon each other to fulfill the concept's purpose and handle various scenarios without redundant state setup.

Therefore, you do not need to convert them into separate `Deno.test` blocks. They are already good as organized.
