# prompt: is my gemini working?

# response:

That depends on which "Gemini" you're referring to, as there are a few prominent services with that name!

Please clarify which one you mean:

1.  **Google Gemini (the AI model, like me):**
    *   **How to check:** If you're currently interacting with me and getting responses, then the underlying Gemini model is working for you! If you're using the Google Gemini web app (formerly Bard), you'd know it's working if you can log in, enter prompts, and receive answers without error messages.
    *   **Issues:** If you're having trouble with the Google Gemini web app, try checking your internet connection, clearing your browser's cache and cookies, or trying a different browser/device.

2.  **Gemini (the cryptocurrency exchange):**
    *   **How to check:**
        *   **Official Status Page:** The best way to check for system-wide issues is to visit their official status page: [https://status.gemini.com/](https://status.gemini.com/)
        *   **Log In:** Try logging into your account on their website or app. If you can access your balances, place trades, and view your history without errors, it's likely working for you.
        *   **Social Media:** Check their official Twitter/X account (@Gemini) for real-time updates on outages or maintenance.
    *   **Issues:** If you're having trouble, check the status page first. If it shows no issues, try clearing your app's cache (for mobile) or your browser's cache/cookies, checking your internet connection, or trying a different device.

3.  **Something else entirely named "Gemini" (e.g., a specific software project, a satellite, etc.):**
    *   Please provide more details if it's not one of the above!

To help me give you a more specific answer, please tell me which Gemini you're asking about and what kind of issues you're experiencing!
