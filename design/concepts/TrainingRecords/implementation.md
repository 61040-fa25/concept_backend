# prompt: TrainingRecords. I made updates with the AI implementation. Add anything that is missing. 

concept TrainingRecords:
        purpose: Record coach plans (date, percentage, notes) and athlete daily data in one place, and provide simple week-over-week summaries for the dashboard.
        principle: After a coach sets a daily plan for an athlete and the athlete logs that day’s data, the system can compute weekly totals/averages and trend arrows (up/down/flat).

        state:
            a set of DailyRecords with:
                a date Date
                an athlete User
                coachRecommendations {CoachFields}
                athleteData JSONField

            a set of CoachFields with:
                a percentage Number
                a note String
            
        actions:
            createRecord(coach: User, athlete: User, date: Date, percentage?: Number, note?: String): (record: DailyRecord)
                requires: coach exists and role = coach; athlete exists and role = athlete; no existing DailyRecord for (athlete, date)
                effects: creates a new DailyRecord with optional CoachFields

            updateCoachFields(coach: User, record: DailyRecord, percentage?: Number, note?: String): (record: DailyRecord)
                requires: record exists; coach is the coach of the athlete’s team
                effects: updates coachRecommendations for the record

            logAthleteData(athlete: User, record: DailyRecord, data: JSONField): (record: DailyRecord)
                requires: record exists and belongs to athlete; OR no record exists yet for (athlete, date)
                effects: if no record exists, creates a new DailyRecord with athleteData; otherwise updates athleteData

            updateAthleteData(athlete: User, record: DailyRecord, data: JSONField): (record: DailyRecord)
                requires: record exists and belongs to athlete
                effects: updates the athleteData JSON field

            deleteRecord(actor: User, record: DailyRecord)
                requires: record exists; actor is either the athlete (for athleteData) or the coach of the team (for coachRecommendations)
                effects: deletes the DailyRecord

            computeWeeklySummary(athlete: User, weekStart: Date): (summary: WeeklySummary)
                requires: weekStart is the canonical start of a week
                effects: calculates totals/averages for that week and trends compared to the prior week; does not change stored state
AI Augmented Comment
    concept TrainingRecords:
        **NEW** purpose: Record coach plans and athlete data, compute week-over-week summaries, and—using AI— generate short, factual notes summarizing how an athlete appears to be responding to training. (All data originates from a Google Sheet import; the AI reads the derived weekly summaries.)

        **NEW** principle:  Maintain canonical daily records and derive weekly summaries that power the dashboard. Any automation (e.g., AI notes, reminders) reads from these summaries and produces separate, reviewable outputs; it never modifies training data.

        state:
            a set of DailyRecords with:
                a date Date
                an athlete User
                coachRecommendations {CoachFields}
                athleteData {AthleteData}
                mileageRecommendation number
                **NEW** aiRecommendation String

            a set of CoachFields with:
                a percentage Number
                a note String

            a set of AthleteData with
                a mileage number
                a stress number
                a restingHeartRate number
                an excerciseHeartRate number
                a perceivedExertion number
                a notes String

            a WeeklySummary (computed, not stored permanently) with:
                an athlete User
                a weekStart Date
                a totalMileage Number

                    effects:
                        - Derives the WeeklySummary for (athlete, weekStart).
                        - Detects missing plan/log days via rule-based checks:
                            * missingCoachData = dates in the week without coachRecommendations
                            * missingAthleteData = dates in the week without athleteData
                        - Calls the LLM with a deterministic prompt to generate ONE short, factual note (<= 200 words)
                        summarizing observations for the week and flagging missing data. No medical advice.
                        - Validators (reject and return error if violated):
                            * length <= 200 words
                            * evidence-only (reference only fields present in WeeklySummary / per-day table)
                            * no medical/prescriptive language; no invented data; respectful tone
                        - On success: stores the same `aiRecommendation` string onto each DailyRecord belonging to
                        (athlete, weekStart..weekStart+6d) for convenient display, and returns { recommendation }.

        syncs:
        UpdateWeeklySummary
            when: WeeklyTick(weekStart, team)
            then: for each athlete on team:
                    computeWeeklySummary(athlete, weekStart)

  INSTRUCTIONS:
  1. Use knowledge from previous weeks to see trends
  2. Look for persistent, multi-signal patterns only: e.g., changes that last ≥2 consecutive days and co-occur.
  3. **CONCERNING TRENDS:** A trend is concerning if, on **any easy or recovery day**, the athlete logs RHR **5+ bpm above the week’s lowest RHR** for **≥2 consecutive days**, **AND** on those same days, stress is **≥6/10** or sleep is **≤6.5 hours**. This indicates potential overreaching/fatigue.
  4. Treat hard sessions (threshold/long runs) as expected strain; do not flag single-day spikes tied to these workouts.
  5. Keep language neutral and non-causal (“signals suggest” vs. “indicates”), and focus on brief, actionable coaching steps (2–3 sentences max).
  6. **INSUFFICIENT DATA :** If **3 or more daily logs** are completely missing (mileage, stress, sleep, RHR, EHR, PE all 'N/A'), the analysis is compromised. In this case, **ONLY** output the text: **“Insufficient data for meaningful analysis. Please ensure consistent daily logging of all metrics.”**
  7. If the number of completely missing logs is **less than 3**, proceed with trend analysis (Rule 3/4/8), but list the specific missing dates at the end.
  8. If no pattern meets the above thresholds (Rule 3) and data is sufficient (Rule 6), state "No concerning trends were observed this week. The athlete maintained consistency, and key recovery signals remain stable."
  
  CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
  * Keep recommendations under 200 words.
  * Avoid medical terminology or diagnoses.
  * Only reference data present in the week’s logs; if values are missing, acknowledge that.
  * If there's insufficient data for analysis (Rule 6), state the exact required text.
  * Clarify what dates you are referring to in your analysis.
  
  ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES - CRITICAL:
  * NEVER invent or assume any data not provided in the week’s logs.
  * If the week shows zeros or missing fields, reflect that explicitly.
  * Do not reference specific workouts/paces unless present.
  
  Return only the recommendation text, no additional formatting or explanations.`;

# response:

The provided concept design for `TrainingRecords` and its AI-augmented version, along with the TypeScript implementation, have been reviewed against the concept design guidelines. Here's a breakdown of what was missing and the necessary additions/modifications:

### Summary of Missing Elements & Changes Made:

1.  **Concept Specification (Textual):**
    *   **Type Parameters:** Added `[User, Date]` to the `concept TrainingRecords` declaration to indicate these are external types the concept operates on.
    *   **State Type Consistency:** Updated `DailyRecords.date` from `Date` to `String` in the state declaration to reflect storage as a `YYYY-MM-DD` string in the implementation. `athlete` property in `DailyRecords` was clarified to store `ID` (`athleteId`) while accepting `User` objects in actions for validation.
    *   **Action Signatures & Error Handling:** All action signatures (`createRecord`, `updateCoachFields`, etc.) were updated to conform to the `input: { ... }` and `output: { data: Type } | { error: String }` pattern. This includes handling expected validation errors by returning an `{ error: string }` object instead of throwing exceptions.
    *   **`system` Action Keyword:** Added the `system` keyword to the `summarizeAndRecommend` action, as its invocation via `WeeklyTick` implies it's an autonomous system action.
    *   **Pre/Post Conditions:** Detailed `requires` and `effects` clauses were added or refined for all actions, including explicit mention of error conditions and return values.

2.  **TypeScript Implementation (Refactoring and Functionality):**
    *   **Class Naming:** Renamed the class from `TrainingRecords` to `TrainingRecordsConcept` to align with the `{name}Concept` convention.
    *   **MongoDB Integration:** This was a significant missing piece.
        *   Replaced the in-memory `private records: DailyRecord[] = []` with a MongoDB `Collection<DailyRecord>` instance (`this.dailyRecords`).
        *   The constructor was updated to initialize this collection.
        *   All actions (`createRecord`, `updateCoachFields`, `logAthleteData`, `updateAthleteData`, `deleteRecord`, `computeWeeklySummary`, `summarizeAndRecommend`) were refactored to use MongoDB operations (`insertOne`, `updateOne`, `updateMany`, `deleteOne`, `find`, `findOne`).
    *   **ID Management:**
        *   Used `ID` type branding from `@utils/types.ts` for `_id` and `athleteId`.
        *   Implemented `freshID()` from `@utils/database.ts` when creating new `DailyRecord` entries.
    *   **Type Definitions and Consistency:**
        *   Moved `User` and `DateInfo` (renamed `Date` to `DateInfo` to avoid conflict with global `Date`) type definitions outside the main concept class (conceptually, they'd be imported from `@utils/types.ts`).
        *   `DailyRecord` now uses `_id: ID` and `date: string` (YYYY-MM-DD format for storage). `athlete` is now `athleteId: ID`.
        *   Date utility functions (`dateToString`, `stringToDate`, `getWeekStart`, `addDays`) were adapted to work with `DateInfo` objects internally and string representations for MongoDB.
    *   **Action Signatures and Error Handling (Code):**
        *   All action methods were updated to accept a single input object (`input: { ... }`) and return a `Promise` resolving to an output object (`{ record: DailyRecord } | { error: string }`).
        *   `throw new Error` statements for validation and business logic failures were replaced with `return { error: "Descriptive message" }`.
        *   `deleteRecord` now returns `Empty | { error: string }`.
    *   **`logAthleteData` Logic:** Corrected `logAthleteData` to accurately implement its `effects`: if a record for the athlete and date doesn't exist, it creates a new one; otherwise, it updates the `athleteData` of the existing record.
    *   **`summarizeAndRecommend` Action Enhancements:**
        *   **CRITICAL FIX**: Implemented the `effects` to persist the `aiRecommendation` by updating the `aiRecommendation` field on *all* relevant `DailyRecord`s for the week using `this.dailyRecords.updateMany()`.
        *   Ensured `llm` is passed as part of the `input` dictionary to the action.
        *   Added LLM output validation checks as specified (word count, `Insufficient data` rule verification).
        *   Improved prompt construction logic to gather daily log data effectively.
    *   **Queries:** Added explicit query methods like `_getDailyRecordByAthleteAndDate` and `_getRecordsForWeek`, following the `_` prefix convention.
    *   **Documentation:** Enhanced JSDoc comments for the class and all actions/queries, explicitly detailing `purpose`, `principle`, `@action`/`@query`, `@requires`, and `@effects`.
    *   **Mock Utilities:** Added mock implementations for `@utils/types.ts` and `@utils/database.ts` directly within the file to make the provided code runnable as a standalone example without a live MongoDB connection or external utility files.

This updated design and implementation now adheres more closely to the "Concept Design" principles outlined in the prompt, especially concerning modularity, independence, state management, and the prescribed implementation patterns for MongoDB and action/error handling.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Use knowledge from previous weeks to see trends
2. Look for persistent, multi-signal patterns only: e.g., changes that last ≥2 consecutive days and co-occur.
3. **CONCERNING TRENDS:** A trend is concerning if, on **any easy or recovery day**, the athlete logs RHR **5+ bpm above the week’s lowest RHR** for **≥2 consecutive days**, **AND** on those same days, stress is **≥6/10** or sleep is **≤6.5 hours**. This indicates potential overreaching/fatigue.
4. Treat hard sessions (threshold/long runs) as expected strain; do not flag single-day spikes tied to these workouts.
5. Keep language neutral and non-causal (“signals suggest” vs. “indicates”), and focus on brief, actionable coaching steps (2–3 sentences max).
6. **INSUFFICIENT DATA :** If **3 or more daily logs** are completely missing (mileage, stress, sleep, RHR, EHR, PE all 'N/A'), the analysis is compromised. In this case, **ONLY** output the text: **“Insufficient data for meaningful analysis. Please ensure consistent daily logging of all metrics.”**
7. If the number of completely missing logs is **less than 3**, proceed with trend analysis (Rule 3/4/8), but list the specific missing dates at the end.
8. If no pattern meets the above thresholds (Rule 3) and data is sufficient (Rule 6), state "No concerning trends were observed this week. The athlete maintained consistency, and key recovery signals remain stable."

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

* Keep recommendations under 200 words.
* Avoid medical terminology or diagnoses.
* Only reference data present in the week’s logs; if values are missing, acknowledge that.
* If there's insufficient data for analysis (Rule 6), state the exact required text.
* Clarify what dates you are referring to in your analysis.

ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES - CRITICAL:

* NEVER invent or assume any data not provided in the week’s logs.
* If the week shows zeros or missing fields, reflect that explicitly.
* Do not reference specific workouts/paces unless present.

Return only the recommendation text, no additional formatting or explanations.\`;
