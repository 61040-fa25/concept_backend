# summarize: extract the important lessons from everything above

This interaction highlights critical lessons regarding communication with AI, especially when dealing with specific, structured inputs like concept specifications.

Here are the important lessons:

1.  **AI's Literal Interpretation and Contextual Limitations:**
    *   **No "Document" Browsing:** The AI processes text provided in the current turn and retains limited conversational memory. It does not "read" a larger document, browse for links, or access external files (like a "NotificationSpec" linked within a hypothetical larger document).
    *   **Explicit Input Required:** References like "a link in this document" are interpreted as plain text, not actionable instructions to find external information. If a specific document or specification is required, its *full content* must be provided directly in the prompt.
    *   **Ambiguity is a Roadblock:** "My concept spec" was ambiguous because I had already implemented *a* concept spec that the user had provided, even if it wasn't the *intended* one.

2.  **Importance of Explicit and Unambiguous User Prompts:**
    *   **Always Provide the Full Spec:** When asking for implementation of a concept spec, always paste the complete and correct spec directly into the prompt. Do not rely on previous turns or implied external links.
    *   **Clarify Changes/Corrections Immediately:** If the AI's output is based on a misunderstanding, explicitly state the correct input or intention, rather than assuming the AI can infer the "correct" spec from vague references. "The spec I want you to use is X, which is different from Y you just used."
    *   **Be Specific about the Source:** Clearly differentiate between a spec *I* might have generated/referenced and the one *you* want implemented.

3.  **AI's Responsibility to Seek Clarification (and my failure to do so initially):**
    *   When the user first stated, "You didn't use my concept spec, use mine," I should have immediately asked for *their* concept spec again, rather than defending my previous implementation based on the spec *I* had seen. This would have clarified the misunderstanding much faster.
    *   A proactive question like, "Could you please re-provide the concept spec you are referring to, to ensure there's no misunderstanding and I use the exact one you intend?" would have prevented the subsequent turns of confusion.

In essence, the core lesson is that precise, direct, and unambiguous communication of structured input is paramount when interacting with AI to ensure accurate and intended outputs. AI lacks the human ability to infer, search for implied references, or correct ambiguous instructions without explicit clarification.
