Concept design is introduced as a new approach to software development primarily to achieve **greater modularity in the structuring of application functionality**.

Here are the key reasons and advantages of Concept Design, as outlined in the text:

1.  **Improved Modularity and Separability:**
    *   The core idea is to break functionality into *separable, modular services called concepts*.
    *   This allows each concept to be specified, implemented, and understood separately by both users and developers.

2.  **Enhanced Separation of Concerns:**
    *   Each concept addresses only a single, coherent aspect of an application's functionality, preventing the conflation of different functional aspects often seen in traditional designs (e.g., a `User` class handling authentication, profiles, naming, and notifications).
    *   This leads to simpler and more robust design and implementation.

3.  **Concept Independence:**
    *   This is highlighted as perhaps the *most significant distinguishing feature*.
    *   Each concept is defined *without reference to any other concepts* and can be understood in isolation.
    *   This independence allows design to scale, enabling different designers or teams to work on concepts concurrently.
    *   It's crucial for reuse, as coupling between concepts would prevent a concept from being adopted without also including its dependencies.

4.  **Completeness of Functionality:**
    *   Concepts are *complete* with respect to their functionality and do not rely on functionality from other concepts. If a concept has an action, that action's full implementation is contained within the concept itself.

5.  **Greater Recognition and Facilitation of Reuse:**
    *   Most concepts are reusable across different applications (e.g., the *Upvote* concept on the New York Times and Stack Overflow).
    *   A concept can also be instantiated multiple times within the same application.
    *   This reduces work for designers and developers by allowing them to leverage existing design knowledge and experience, potentially even through "concept catalogs."

6.  **Improved User Familiarity and Understanding:**
    *   The archetypal and reusable nature of concepts means users encounter familiar interaction patterns in new settings, making applications easier to understand.

7.  **Improved Focus on Purpose and Motivation:**
    *   Each concept is closely targeted at delivering a particular function of value within the larger application, ensuring clarity on its purpose and motivations.
    *   Concepts maintain their own state and interact through atomic actions, supporting a well-defined and intelligible purpose.

8.  **Scalable Composition through Synchronization:**
    *   Because concepts are independent, they are composed using *synchronizations* (syncs) rather than direct dependencies. This mechanism allows concepts to interact and achieve combined functionality without sacrificing their individual independence, further supporting modularity and scalability.
