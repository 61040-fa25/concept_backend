# 6.104 Assignment 4a: Implementing Concepts

In this assignment, I implemented my three concepts for my TaskTackler app: TaskBank, Sessions, and ListCreation. In doing so, I chronicled the changes from my original spec and the different hurdles I had to overcome in the process of implementation in individual design journey files:

- [ListCreation](/design/concepts/ListCreation/listCreationDesignJourney.md)

- [Session](/design/concepts/Session/sessionDesignJourney.md)

- [TaskBank](/design/concepts/TaskBank/taskBankDesignJourney.md)

From there, I also chronicled the overall changes and design process, including highlighting some of the most interesting problems I encountered and lessons learned.
