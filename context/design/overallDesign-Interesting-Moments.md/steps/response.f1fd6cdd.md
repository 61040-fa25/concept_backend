Here's a concise summary of the important lessons, focusing on the interaction regarding the `ProgressTracking` concept:

1. **Strict Representation Independence (Reiterated):** Tests (and by extension, the concept's internal implementation) should strictly adhere to "representation independence." This means that public queries should return only the necessary public identifiers or properties, and internal data structures (`NotificationDoc` vs. `Notification` ID, `PlanProperties` vs. `PlanIdentifier`) should remain encapsulated.

2. **Robust Test Isolation (Reiterated):** Each test scenario must operate in a clean, isolated environment to ensure determinism and prevent state leakage. This typically involves setting up and tearing down resources (like database connections) for *each logical test block*.

3. **Structured Documentation and Context (`@` annotations):**
   * **Lesson:** When refining a concept implementation, explicitly adding JSDoc-style annotations (e.g., `@action`, `@requires`, `@effect`, `@purpose`, `@principle`, `@query`) to the concept definition and its implementation is crucial for enhancing **clarity, maintainability, and self-documentation**.
   * **AI's Interpretation:** The AI correctly interpreted these `@` annotations in the *second iteration* of the `ProgressTracking` concept as **metadata and structured comments** to be embedded within the code's JSDoc. It successfully integrated them around the existing logical structure of the class and its methods.
   * **Key Nuance on AI's Behavior:** The observation that the AI "wouldn't incorporate the new context and change your implementation" in the sense of *altering the core logic* highlights that these annotations, while providing rich descriptive context, are treated as *formalizing documentation* of existing logic, rather than *new functional requirements* that demand a fundamental change to an already defined implementation. The `requires` and `effects` described by the `@` tags were already handled by the first implementation's logic; the tags just made them explicit. If a *functional change* is needed, it must be stated as a direct modification to the concept's behavior or state, not merely as a documentation tag.

In essence, while the `@` annotations were vital for creating a well-documented and understandable implementation, they primarily served to *describe* the existing functional design rather than *dictate a change* to it, as the underlying requirements for the implementation were already present in the initial concept definition.
