# Notification Concept

[20251015\_203844.06aca8e2](../context/design/concepts/Notification/testing.md/20251015_203844.06aca8e2.md)

1. **Nuance of "Representation Independence":** The core challenge was precisely interpreting "tests shouldn't reference internal representation." This isn't just about not importing internal interfaces but about how query results are structured to avoid exposing underlying data models.
2. **Deno Runtime Evolution:** The rapid changes in Deno's API (e.g., `Deno.sleep` introduction, then removal; `allow-hrtime` permission changes) led to a cycle of fixes for platform-specific issues.
3. **Cascading Test Failures:** Fixing one conceptual error (like representation independence) often uncovered underlying architectural issues in the tests (like state leakage), which then required new solutions.

**Here are the important lessons extracted from this interaction:**

1. **Strict Representation Independence in Tests (Crucial):**
   * **Concept:** Tests should behave as an "external user" only interacting with the concept's *public API* (actions and queries).
   * **Implementation:**
     * `Notification` (exported as `ID`) represents the public identifier.
     * `NotificationDoc` (internal interface) represents the MongoDB document structure.
     * **Key change:** The `_getAllNotifications` query was adjusted to explicitly use `projection: { _id: 1 }` and map the results (`.map(n => n._id)`), ensuring it *only returns `Notification` IDs*, not full `NotificationDoc` objects, thereby upholding representation independence for the query's output as per the revised specification.
     * Tests strictly use `Notification` (the ID type) for all assertions on identifiers received from the concept.

2. **Test Isolation is Paramount:**
   * **Concept:** Each test case (especially "interesting cases") should run in a clean, isolated environment to prevent state leakage and ensure determinism.
   * **Implementation:** Refactoring `test.step` blocks within a single `Deno.test` into **separate `Deno.test` blocks**, each with its own `const [db, client] = await testDb();` and `await client.close();`. This ensures a fresh database instance and concept for every logical test scenario.

3. **Deno Asynchronous Operations & Leak Detection:**
   * **Concept:** Deno's test runner is strict about resource management. Unclosed timers or network connections lead to "leaks detected" errors.
   * **Implementation:**
     * Replaced `setTimeout(resolve, ms)` with `await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));` for introducing delays. This is the current idiomatic and leak-safe way in modern Deno versions (post `Deno.sleep` removal).
     * Added a small `await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 50));` before `client.close()` at the end of each `Deno.test` block. This heuristic provides a grace period for the MongoDB client to fully close its underlying network connections, often mitigating `op_read` and `TLS connection` leak warnings.

4. **Error Handling (TypeScript `unknown`):**
   * **Concept:** Catching `unknown` errors requires type-guarding to safely access properties like `e.message`.
   * **Implementation:** Using `e instanceof Error ? e.message : String(e)` to extract error messages reliably.
