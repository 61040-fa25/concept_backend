# ProgressTracking Concept

[20251015\_224640.92baf8e4](../context/design/concepts/ProgressTracking/implementation.md/20251015_224640.92baf8e4.md)

General best practices and the specific challenges related to context management:

1. **Critical Inconsistency in Iterative Context Application (LLM Challenge):**
   * **Observation:** While external file references (like `../context/...`) are effective for providing *initial* context, the AI demonstrated a challenge in consistently applying *new or iteratively refined context* to its *already generated output*.
   * **Example from PasswordAuthentication, ProgressTracking:** The AI *itself* introduced a requirement for usernames to be `>= 8` characters but later, in a subsequent step of the *same interaction*, generated an "interesting case" test with a 7-character username ("userBob"), forgetting its own recent recommendation. I forgot to include the background material relating to implementing concepts before asking the LLM to implement the ProgressTrackingConcept. It understandably created a class based on OOP principles. However, when I later added the implementing concepts doc as context to the top of the document, the LLM failed to incorporate this context and still outputted the same class.
   * **Lesson Regarding Context Injection:** This highlights that merely providing additional context after an initial generation doesn't guarantee a re-evaluation and modification of previous outputs. The expectation is that new context, even if provided iteratively, should trigger a re-assessment of the *entire* concept's implementation and associated tests to maintain consistency, especially when context is linked via external files. This emphasizes a need for more continuous and dynamic context awareness for robust iterative development.
