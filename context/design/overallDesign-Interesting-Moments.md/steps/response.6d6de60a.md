# response:

To test the `PasswordAuthenticationConcept`, we'll create a dedicated test file. This file will connect to a temporary in-memory (or test) MongoDB database, initialize the concept, and run various assertions against its actions.

First, ensure you have the Deno test runner set up. You might need a `deno.json` similar to the one provided in the instructions, and a `deno.lock` file generated by running `deno cache --reload src/PasswordAuthentication/PasswordAuthenticationConcept.ts`.
