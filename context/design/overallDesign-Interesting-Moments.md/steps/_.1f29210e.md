[20251017\_184647.70888acc](../context/src/concepts/TripCostEstimation/TripCostEstimationConcept.test.ts/20251017_184647.70888acc.md)
When testing "Test 3: Interesting Case - Zero-day Trip / Same fromDate and toDate Calculation", the test failed because the LLM failed to return a properly-formatted JSON, but the very next time I ran the test, it passed, exemplifying the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the need to have robust checks as part of the TripCostEstimationConcept parsing private function, which is present. An error should be displayed "nicely" to the user and the user should be able to manually enter the trip's total cost amount.
