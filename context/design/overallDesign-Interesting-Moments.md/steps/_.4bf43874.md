TripCostEstimation: In designing the frontend, I realized how redundant it would be to check that the cities listed as from and to locations exist
in some set database when the concept uses an LLM which can check if these
locations do indeed exist. This reduces error checking and gives more
freedom to the user to choose from a large number of cities.
