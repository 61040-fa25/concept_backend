Important lessons extracted from our interaction, with a focus on the `ProgressTracking Concept`:

1. **Ambiguous Query Specifications Lead to Undesired Exposure (LLM Interpretation):**
   When the `ProgressTracking` concept initially defined the `_getPlans` query with the effect "returns an array of all existing Plans belonging to user," but `Plan` itself was an `ID` type, the LLM interpreted this as a request for *all plan details* (i.e., `PlanOutput[]`). This was an attempt to provide a useful, comprehensive output given the ambiguity, but it **exposed internal representation** (`PlansDoc` fields) and conflicted with the principle of "Strict Representation Independence" established in prior concepts.

2. **Explicit Return Type Definitions are Crucial for Queries:**
   To enforce representation independence consistently, query specifications *must* precisely define the structure of their output. A clearer initial specification like "returns an array of Plan IDs belonging to user" would have prevented the initial over-exposure. The user's explicit prompt to "change getPlans to only return Plan IDs" successfully rectified this by enforcing `Array<{ plans: Plan }>`.

3. **Action Return Values for Confirmation:**
   The refined `ProgressTracking` concept (in your final prompt) demonstrates best practice by explicitly defining return values for actions like `createPlan`, `addAmount`, `removeAmount`, and `updateGoalStatus` (e.g., `currentAmount: Number`, `goalReachedFlag: boolean`). This allows external users to immediately confirm the direct effects of an action with minimal data exposure, rather than relying solely on separate queries to infer state changes.
