# trace:

The principle for the `PasswordAuthentication` concept states: "a user must register with a string username and password and subsequent attempts to login is authenticated by matching the ensuring a user exists with the exact username and password".

Below is a trace demonstrating how this principle is fulfilled through the concept's actions.

**Trace: User Registration and Authentication Flow**

1. **Initial State**: The `PasswordAuthentication.users` collection is empty.

2. **Action**: `register({ username: "john.doe", password: "MyStrongPassword123!" })`
   * **Description**: A new user attempts to register with a unique username and a strong password.
   * **Requires Check**:
     * `username` "john.doe" is not found in `PasswordAuthentication.users` (satisfied, as the collection is empty).
     * `password` length is 20, which is >= 8 characters (satisfied).
   * **Effect**:
     * A new document is inserted into `PasswordAuthentication.users` with `_id` (e.g., "user:123"), `username: "john.doe"`, and a `passwordHash` of "MyStrongPassword123!".
     * The action returns `{ user: "user:123" }`.
   * **State After Action**: `PasswordAuthentication.users` now contains one user record.

3. **Action**: `authenticate({ username: "john.doe", password: "MyStrongPassword123!" })`
   * **Description**: The same user attempts to log in using the exact username and password they registered with.
   * **Requires Check**:
     * `username` "john.doe" is found in `PasswordAuthentication.users` (satisfied, from step 2).
   * **Effect**:
     * The provided `password` "MyStrongPassword123!" is hashed and compared against the stored `passwordHash` associated with "john.doe".
     * The comparison is successful, indicating a match.
     * The action returns `{ user: "user:123" }`.
   * **State After Action**: `PasswordAuthentication.users` remains unchanged.

**Principle Fulfilled**: This trace clearly shows that a user successfully registers (step 2) and subsequently authenticates with the exact credentials (step 3), validating the principle that "a user must register with a string username and password and subsequent attempts to login is authenticated by matching the ensuring a user exists with the exact username and password".
