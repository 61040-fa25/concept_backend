# response:

The key here is to decide if `Font` should be an opaque identifier (like an `ID`) that *could* eventually point to a managed entity in a `Font` concept, or if it's simply a descriptive string that the `TextSettings` concept stores and doesn't interpret further.

Given your statement "I don't have an additional concept for the Font, I just want to be able to represent fonts somehow," the simplest and most appropriate approach for `TextSettings`'s scope and independence is to represent `Font` as a `String`. This aligns with the idea that `TextSettings` is concerned with *which* font is selected, not the management or validation of fonts themselves. The front-end would consume this string and handle its rendering, potentially with fallbacks.

This change simplifies the concept by removing `Font` from its generic parameters and explicitly defining it as a `String` in its state.

Here's how to modify the concept specification and the implementation:
