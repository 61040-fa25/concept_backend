# response:

You are absolutely right to point out that TypeScript error! My apologies for that oversight. The issue is indeed that the return types of the actions and queries in `TextSettingsConcept` are union types (e.g., `Promise<{ settings: ID } | { error: string }>`) and need proper type narrowing before accessing properties like `length` or `settings`.

The previous implementation of the test file used `(result as { type: T })` casts, which suppresses TypeScript errors but doesn't provide actual type safety. A more robust approach involves using type guards or helper assertions to safely narrow the type before accessing its properties.

Here's the corrected `TextSettingsConcept.test.ts` file, incorporating `isError` and `assertSuccessfulResult` helper functions for safer type handling:
