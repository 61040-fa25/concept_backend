# response:

You are absolutely, 100% correct. My apologies once again. I deeply regret providing incorrect information and causing further frustration. You've correctly interpreted the Deno documentation: `Deno.test.beforeEach()` runs before each *top-level* `Deno.test()` call, **not** before each `test.step()` call within a suite.

This means my previous solution, while using global hooks, still allowed state to leak between your `test.step` calls because `Deno.test.beforeEach()` was only executing once at the very beginning of the entire "Profile Concept Tests Suite" `Deno.test` block.

Thank you for your persistence and for holding me accountable to the documentation. This kind of precise feedback is invaluable.

### The Corrected Solution

To genuinely ensure a clean state before *each* `test.step()`, we must explicitly perform the setup and cleanup for the concept's state *within each `test.step` itself*.

This approach:

1. Keeps the database connection (`dbInstance`, `clientInstance`) initialized once for the entire file in `Deno.test.beforeAll` and closed in `Deno.test.afterAll`.
2. Removes the faulty `Deno.test.beforeEach`.
3. Inside *every* `test.step()` function, we will now instantiate a new `ProfileConcept` and immediately call `clearCollections()` on it.

This will lead to some repetition, but it is the correct way to achieve per-step isolation with `test.step` according to Deno's current testing API.

***

### **1. `src/concepts/Profile/ProfileConcept.ts` (No Change Needed)**

The `clearCollections()` method you added is perfect and essential for this fix. It remains as is:

```typescript
// ... (imports and interface as before)

export default class ProfileConcept {
  private users: Collection<UserDocument>;
  private readonly SALT_ROUNDS = 10;

  constructor(private readonly db: Db) {
    this.users = this.db.collection(PREFIX + "users");
  }

  /**
   * Clears all collections managed by the ProfileConcept.
   * This is primarily for testing purposes to ensure a clean state before each test.
   */
  async clearCollections(): Promise<void> {
    await this.users.deleteMany({});
  }

  // ... (all other actions and queries as before) ...
}
```

***

### **2. `src/concepts/Profile/ProfileConcept.test.ts` (Corrected Structure)**

Here's the updated test file, with the setup moved into each `test.step`:

```typescript
import { assertEquals, assertNotEquals, assertExists } from "jsr:@std/assert";
import { testDb } from "@utils/database.ts";
import ProfileConcept from "./ProfileConcept.ts";
import { ID } from "@utils/types.ts";
import { Db, MongoClient } from "npm:mongodb";

// Declare shared variables for the database and client.
// These will be initialized once for the entire test file.
let dbInstance: Db;
let clientInstance: MongoClient;

// --- Global Hooks for the entire test file ---

// Hook to run ONCE before ALL tests (and test steps) in this file.
Deno.test.beforeAll(async () => {
  [dbInstance, clientInstance] = await testDb(); // This creates a new DB and drops it ONCE per file.
  console.log("--- Initialized test database for Profile Concept Tests ---");
});

// Hook to run ONCE after ALL tests (and test steps) in this file have completed.
Deno.test.afterAll(async () => {
  if (clientInstance) {
    console.log("--- Closing MongoDB client after Profile Concept Tests ---");
    await clientInstance.close();
  }
});

// --- Main Test Suite ---
Deno.test("Profile Concept Tests Suite", {
  sanitizeResources: false, // Often useful for DB tests that manage external resources
  sanitizeOps: false,       // Often useful for DB tests with async DB operations
}, async (test) => {

  // IMPORTANT: The `beforeEach` hook is removed.
  // Each `test.step` will now explicitly set up its own ProfileConcept instance
  // and clear its state to ensure true isolation.

  await test.step("Action: createAccount - Successful creation", async () => {
