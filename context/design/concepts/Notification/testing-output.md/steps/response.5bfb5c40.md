# response:

You're absolutely right! ANSI escape codes can be tricky and don't always render correctly in all environments, leading to "gibberish." My apologies for that.

Let's go back to using standard Markdown for styling, which is widely supported and will make the output readable and well-formatted in most contexts. I've enhanced the Markdown from the first response to add more emphasis where colors would typically be used.

*   **Effect:** A new celebration notification with ID `0199ea4f-708a-7da8-962c-618288a5bf3b` is ***created*** to celebrate *Alice's* milestone.
