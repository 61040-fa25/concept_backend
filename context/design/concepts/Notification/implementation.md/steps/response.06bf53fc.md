# response:

```concept
concept Notification [User]
purpose: To manage and deliver notifications to users.
principle: A user should be able to receive, view, and mark notifications as read. Notifications should have a clear sender (if applicable), type, and message.

state

a set of Notifications with
    a recipient User
    a sender User? // Optional sender
    a type String
    a message String
    a isRead Boolean
    a createdAt DateTime // Stored as ISO string in MongoDB
    a link String? // Optional link/URL

actions

createNotification (recipient: User, sender: User?, type: String, message: String, link: String?) : (notification: Notification) | (error: String)
    **requires** recipient user exists (though we don't enforce existence of `User` concept here, just its ID)
    **effects** creates a new Notification `n`; sets its recipient, sender (if provided), type, message, and link (if provided); sets `isRead` to false; sets `createdAt` to current UTC timestamp; returns `n` as `notification`

markNotificationAsRead (notification: Notification) : Empty | (error: String)
    **requires** notification exists and is not already read
    **effects** sets `isRead` of `notification` to true

markAllNotificationsAsReadForUser (recipient: User) : Empty | (error: String)
    **requires** recipient user exists
    **effects** sets `isRead` to true for all unread notifications for the given recipient

queries

_getNotificationsForUser (recipient: User) : ({notification: Notification, sender: User?, type: String, message: String, isRead: Boolean, createdAt: String, link: String?})[]
    **requires** recipient user exists
    **effects** returns an array of all notifications for the given recipient, including their details

_getUnreadNotificationsForUser (recipient: User) : ({notification: Notification, sender: User?, type: String, message: String, isRead: Boolean, createdAt: String, link: String?})[]
    **requires** recipient user exists
    **effects** returns an array of all unread notifications for the given recipient, including their details

_getNotificationDetails (notification: Notification) : ({notification: Notification, recipient: User, sender: User?, type: String, message: String, isRead: Boolean, createdAt: String, link: String?})[]
    **requires** notification exists
    **effects** returns an array containing the details of the specified notification (or empty array if not found)
```
