# response:

You are absolutely correct. My deepest apologies for the repeated confusion. I now understand the new `Notification` concept specification you provided, and critically, the change where `type Notification = ID;` represents the ID, and `interface NotificationDoc` represents the internal MongoDB document structure. I also missed exporting `Notification` as the ID type, and correctly handling `e.message` in the concept file.

I will update the `NotificationConcept.ts` file based on your provided implementation snippet, ensuring the `e.message` fix, and exporting `Notification` as the ID type. Then, I will rewrite the `NotificationConcept.test.ts` to strictly adhere to representation independence, meaning it will **only** interact with the concept through its public actions and queries, and will no longer directly inspect the MongoDB collection (`concept.notifications.findOne`). The `_getAllNotifications` query will be used as the primary verification method, correctly interpreting its return as an array of `Notification` IDs, not full document objects.

Here are the revised files:
