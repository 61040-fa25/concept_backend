* **Principle**: If a user is registered with a name and email, then their details can be retrieved later.
  1. Register a user "Alice Smith" with email "alice@example.com".
  2. Obtain the `user` ID returned by the `registerUser` action.
  3. Query for the user details using the obtained `user` ID.
  4. Verify that the retrieved details match the initial registration information (name, email, and ID).
