# response:

To refactor the tests, we will separate each distinct logical test case into its own `Deno.test` block. This improves isolation and readability. A `setupTestEnvironment` helper function will be introduced to reduce boilerplate in each test, providing pre-populated `Locations` and a `User`.

The "Principle Trace" will remain as a single `Deno.test` block to demonstrate the end-to-end flow. For "interesting cases," we'll explicitly mark a few tests that highlight important error conditions or edge cases.
