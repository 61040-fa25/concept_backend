# response:

To correctly address the "timer leak" error, we need to ensure that the `setTimeout` created within the `executeWithTimeout` method of the `GeminiLLM` class is always cleared, regardless of whether the LLM API call resolves first or the timeout is reached.

The `Promise.race` construct allows us to wait for the first promise to settle, but it doesn't automatically cancel the other promises or their associated timers. By capturing the `setTimeout` ID and explicitly calling `clearTimeout` when the `llmPromise` (the actual API call) settles, we prevent the timer from lingering.

Here's the updated `src/utils/gemini-llm.ts` file with this fix, and the `src/TripCostEstimation/TripCostEstimationConcept.test.ts` file with `sanitizeTimers: false` removed.
