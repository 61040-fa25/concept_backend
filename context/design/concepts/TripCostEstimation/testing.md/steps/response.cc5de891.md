# response:

Here's the refactored test file for `TripCostEstimationConcept`, making tests more concise and removing the explicit re-definition of `*Doc` interfaces in the test file, as requested. The concept class itself remains unchanged.

The `setupTestEnvironment` helper is now more lean, providing just the necessary setup, and assertions are directly made against the results of the concept's actions and queries, and implicitly verified against the database state when necessary for effects.
