# response:

This test (`TripCostEstimationConcept: Interesting Case - Sequential Estimates for Same Plan`) concisely verifies that calling `generateAICostEstimate` multiple times for the same `travelPlan` correctly **replaces** any existing cost estimate with a new one, rather than creating duplicate estimates. It specifically checks the "upsert" behavior, ensuring only one cost estimate is stored per travel plan at any given time.
