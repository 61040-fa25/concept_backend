# response:

You are absolutely correct. My apologies for consistently reverting to precondition violations and for the verbosity. The request for "interesting" cases *satisfying* preconditions is a much better way to test robust system behavior and demonstrate value.

I will remove the old, verbose, and precondition-violating tests and replace them with new tests that:

1. Focus on valid, complex, or edge-case scenarios that respect preconditions.
2. Demonstrate the interplay of actions.
3. Are concise and use the public API for verification.
4. Are limited to one principle trace and 3-5 interesting cases (total max 6 tests).
5. Remove `sanitizeTimers: false` as the `GeminiLLM` class has been updated to manage its timers.

Here's the refined test file for `TripCostEstimationConcept.test.ts`.
