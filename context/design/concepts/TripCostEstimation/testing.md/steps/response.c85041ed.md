# response:

The instruction "If you explicitly queried the database, you shouldn't have" coupled with "DON'T change the concept class" and "queries MUST return an **array**" creates a strong constraint. It implies that all state verification must happen through the concept's existing public API (actions and queries), and internal collections (`concept["collection"]`) should not be accessed directly in the tests for verification.

Given that the `TripCostEstimationConcept` only provides one query, `_getAllTravelPlans`, which returns an array of `TravelPlan` IDs (not full `TravelPlansDoc` objects), it becomes impossible to verify the detailed content of created or updated documents (like `fromCity`, `toDate`, `accommodation` status, or specific cost estimates) using *only* the public API. The tests will therefore focus on:

1. Verifying that actions return the correct IDs or an empty object on success.
2. Verifying that actions return an `{error: string}` object when requirements are not met.
3. Verifying the existence or non-existence of `TravelPlan` IDs using `_getAllTravelPlans`.
4. Directly verifying the output of `estimateCost`, as its effect is its direct return value.

This approach will result in more "black-box" tests, where the internal state cannot be fully inspected from the test file itself. I will add comments to the tests to highlight where detailed state verification is omitted due to these constraints.

Here's the revised test file:
