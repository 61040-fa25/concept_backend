# response:

You are absolutely correct to point this out. My apologies for the oversight.

If the fix implemented in `src/utils/gemini-llm.ts` (explicitly calling `clearTimeout` when the `llmPromise` settles) is effective, then `sanitizeTimers: false` should **not be necessary** in any of the tests that use `GeminiLLM`. Its continued presence indicates a potential flaw in the previous reasoning or implementation of the fix.

The goal was to make `GeminiLLM` self-sanitizing regarding its timers. If Deno is still detecting a leak, it means `clearTimeout` isn't being hit, or there's another timer initiated that isn't being managed.

Let's remove `sanitizeTimers: false` from `TripCostEstimationConcept.test.ts` entirely. If the tests still fail with a timer leak, it means the fix in `gemini-llm.ts` isn't fully robust, and further investigation into `GeminiLLM`'s internal timer management would be needed. For this problem, however, let's assume the `clearTimeout` logic is sufficient and remove the `sanitizeTimers` flag.

Here's the corrected test file:
