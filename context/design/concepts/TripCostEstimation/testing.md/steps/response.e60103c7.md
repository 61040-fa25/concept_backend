# response:

You are absolutely right. The error "Class 'MockGeminiLLM' incorrectly implements class 'GeminiLLM'. Did you mean to extend 'GeminiLLM' and inherit its members as a subclass?" arises because `GeminiLLM` is defined as a concrete class (not an interface), and it has private members (`retryConfig`, `executeWithTimeout`, `callGeminiAPI`, `isNonRetryableError`, `sleep`). When a class uses `implements` with another class, TypeScript expects it to provide implementations for *all* members (public, protected, and private in some strict interpretations, though usually it's about the public contract).

Since `GeminiLLM` is a class and we are forbidden from changing the `TripCostEstimationConcept` (which expects `llm: GeminiLLM`), the correct way for `MockGeminiLLM` to fulfill this type requirement and still provide mock behavior for its public methods is to `extend` `GeminiLLM` and then override the public `executeLLM` method.

Here's the corrected `src/TripCostEstimation/TripCostEstimationConcept.test.ts` file:
