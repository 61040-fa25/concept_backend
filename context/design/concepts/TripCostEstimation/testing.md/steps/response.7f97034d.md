# response:

Under the instruction "no need for MockLLM, use the available methods provided by GeminiLLM for LLM prompting," the `MockGeminiLLM` class will be removed. All tests involving LLM interaction will now use a real instance of `GeminiLLM`.

**Important Considerations and Limitations:**

1. **Environment Variables**: For the `GeminiLLM` to function, the `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_MODEL` environment variables **must be correctly set** in the test environment. If they are not set, the `GeminiLLM` constructor or `executeLLM` call will throw an error, causing the tests to fail.
2. **Real API Calls**: Tests involving `generateAICostEstimate` will now make **actual network calls** to the Google Gemini API. This has several implications:
   * **Speed**: These tests will be significantly slower.
   * **Flakiness**: External network dependencies can introduce flakiness.
   * **Cost**: Each API call may incur usage costs.
   * **Non-determinism**: LLM responses, even with low temperature, are not perfectly deterministic, which can make assertions on exact numeric outputs challenging.
3. **Untestable Scenarios**: Without a mock, it is **impossible to reliably test** several "interesting cases" that were previously covered:
   * **LLM returning invalid JSON**: The real `GeminiLLM` is configured to return `application/json`, making it unlikely to return syntactically invalid JSON under normal operation.
   * **LLM returning incomplete JSON**: While less likely with `responseMimeType: "application/json"`, the LLM could still omit fields. Forcing this reliably without a mock is not feasible.
   * **LLM returning inaccurate values (outside expected bounds)**: This relies on the LLM *intentionally* providing values that trigger the concept's validation logic, which cannot be reliably prompted for a real LLM.
   * **LLM API call failures (e.g., network errors)**: While the real `GeminiLLM` can throw errors for invalid API keys or quota issues, simulating transient network failures or specific API errors without modifying the environment or using a mock is not possible.

Given these limitations, the specific "Interesting Case" tests that relied on precise mock responses for parsing validation (`LLM returns invalid JSON`, `LLM returns incomplete JSON`, `LLM returns inaccurate values`, and `LLM API call fails`) have been commented out or adjusted to reflect what can be tested with a real `GeminiLLM` instance. The "Successful generation" test now uses a real LLM instance.
