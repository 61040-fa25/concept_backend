# response:

You are correct to observe that the changes to `TripCostEstimationConcept.ts` were minimal in response to the update to `gemini-llm.ts`.

The primary change in `TripCostEstimationConcept.ts` involved its **import statement** for `gemini-llm.ts`.

Here's the exact difference:

**Before the `apiKey` update (and after moving interfaces out):**

```typescript
import { GeminiLLM, Config as GeminiLLMConfig } from "@utils/gemini-llm.ts"; // Renamed Config to GeminiLLMConfig to avoid conflict
```

**After the `apiKey` update (where `GeminiLLM` no longer needs a `Config` object in its constructor):**

```typescript
import { GeminiLLM } from "@utils/gemini-llm.ts"; // The Config interface is no longer needed here.
```

The alias `Config as GeminiLLMConfig` was removed from the import because the `GeminiLLM` class's constructor no longer accepts a `Config` object, as it now retrieves the API key directly from environment variables. Therefore, the `TripCostEstimationConcept` no longer needed to import that `Config` type.

No other parts of `TripCostEstimationConcept.ts` (like method signatures or internal logic for actions/queries) were directly altered by this change to how `GeminiLLM` is configured.
