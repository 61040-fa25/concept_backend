# response:

To implement the `Annotation` concept in TypeScript, we'll follow the provided guidelines for concept design and MongoDB integration.

First, here's the specification for the `Annotation` concept:

**concept** Annotation \[User, Document, Location]

**purpose** allow users to create annotations within documents and search amongst their annotations

**principle** When users read a document, they can create and view highlighting or text annotations in the document. Users can label annotations with tags. Users can also search for annotations in a document with specific keywords or about certain ideas.

**state**\
a set of Annotations with:

* a creator User
* a document Document
* an optional color String
* an optional content String
* a location Location
* a tags set of Tags

a set of Tags with:

* a creator User
* a title String

a set of Documents with:

* an annotations set of Annotations
* a creator User

**actions**

createTag(creator: User, title: String): (tag: Tag)

* **requires** a tag with user and title does not already exist
* **effects** creates a tag with title

createAnnotation(creator: User, document: Document, color: String, content: String, location: Location, tags: List\[Tag]): (annotation: Annotation)

* **requires**
  * document exists, and has creator=creator (in this concept's `documents` state)
  * location exists and is well-defined
  * color is either a valid HTML color, or omitted. At least one of color and content must not be omitted
* **effects**
  * creates and adds annotation with creator, document, color, content, location, and tags to the set of Annotations.
  * Adds annotation to the document's set of annotations

deleteAnnotation(user: User, annotation: Annotation)

* **requires** annotation exists and has creator=user
* **effects** removes annotation from all sets of Annotations

updateAnnotation(user: User, annotation: Annotation, newColor: String, newContent: String, newLocation: Location, newTags: List\[Tag]): (annotation: Annotation)

* **requires** annotation has creator=user, newColor (if provided) is a valid HTML color. Any of newColor, newContent, newLocation, and newTags may be omitted.
* **effects** modifies annotation to have color=newColor, content=newContent, location=newLocation, tags=newTags (for each attribute that is not omitted)

search(user: User, document: Document, criteria: String): (annotations: List\[Annotations\\])

* **requires** document exists (in this concept's `documents` state)
* **effects** returns a list of annotations with creator=user in the document that have content or tags matching criteria

searchLLM(user: User, document: Document, description: String, llm: GeminiLLM): (annotations: List\[Annotations])

* **requires** document and llm exist (in this concept's `documents` state)
* **effects** uses llm to identify and return annotations with creator=user in the document that fit the given description

**notes:**

* Location is a generic representation of a location within a document, Document is a generic representation of a document, and color is a generic representation of a color
* I'm not sure exactly how it would work, but depending on the generic Document passed in, there would be an implied location representation associated with it. For example, .epub files (using a library) can represent text location as an index, whereas pdfs treat the entire document as an image (x-y plane for location).
