# trace:

The following trace demonstrates how the **principle** of the `Post` concept is fulfilled by a sequence of actions and queries.

1. **Given**: Two users, `user:Alice` and `user:Bob`. Alice wishes to create, view, and eventually delete her posts.

2. **Action**: `user:Alice` creates her first post.
   ```
   Post.create({ userId: "user:Alice", content: "Hello, world! This is my first post.", timestamp: <current_datetime> })
   ```

3. **Result**: A new post is created in the system, and its unique identifier is returned.
   ```
   { post: "post:alice_first" }
   ```

4. **Action**: `user:Alice` creates a second post.
   ```
   Post.create({ userId: "user:Alice", content: "Another thought for today.", timestamp: <later_datetime> })
   ```

5. **Result**: A second post is created, with a new identifier.
   ```
   { post: "post:alice_second" }
   ```

6. **Action**: `user:Bob` also creates a post.
   ```
   Post.create({ userId: "user:Bob", content: "Bob's opinion on things.", timestamp: <some_datetime> })
   ```

7. **Result**: Bob's post is created with its own identifier.
   ```
   { post: "post:bob_first" }
   ```

8. **Query**: `user:Alice` wants to view all her posts.
   ```
   Post._getPostsByAuthor({ authorId: "user:Alice" })
   ```

9. **Result**: The system returns an array containing both of Alice's posts, `post:alice_first` and `post:alice_second`, demonstrating that her records are retrievable and attributed to her.
   ```
   [
     { post: { _id: "post:alice_first", userId: "user:Alice", content: "Hello, world! This is my first post.", timestamp: <datetime1> } },
     { post: { _id: "post:alice_second", userId: "user:Alice", content: "Another thought for today.", timestamp: <datetime2> } }
   ]
   ```

10. **Query**: `user:Alice` might want to view a specific post by its ID.
    ```
    Post._getPostById({ postId: "post:alice_first" })
    ```

11. **Result**: The system returns the specific post.
    ```
    [
      { post: { _id: "post:alice_first", userId: "user:Alice", content: "Hello, world! This is my first post.", timestamp: <datetime1> } }
    ]
    ```

12. **Action**: `user:Alice` decides to delete her first post.
    ```
    Post.delete({ post: "post:alice_first" })
    ```

13. **Result**: The deletion is successful.
    ```
    {}
    ```

14. **Query**: To verify the deletion, `user:Alice` attempts to retrieve her posts again.
    ```
    Post._getPostsByAuthor({ authorId: "user:Alice" })
    ```

15. **Result**: The system now only returns her second post, confirming that `post:alice_first` has been removed and is no longer retrievable, thereby fulfilling the deletion aspect of the principle.
    ```
    [
      { post: { _id: "post:alice_second", userId: "user:Alice", content: "Another thought for today.", timestamp: <datetime2> } }
    ]
    ```
