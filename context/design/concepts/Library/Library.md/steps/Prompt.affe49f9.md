# Prompt: I'm looking at the Document state, and it seems like there's a lot of things there. Would it make more sense to have the Document (in the library concept) to only have a name and binary data, and then have a Set of Documents in the TextSettings concept with state of only a var TextSettings, and a Set of Documents in the FocusStats concept with only a var FocusStats?
