# Prompt: So I'm not saying that the document shouldn't have all of that functionality. I'm saying that documents, as they pertain to uses in the Library concept, only need a name, library, and binary data. Similarly, documents, as they pertain to FocusStats, only need a stat FocusStats. Similarly, documents, as they pertain to TextSettings, only need a settings TextSettings. This highlights separations of concerns between the different concepts, rather than trying to force all of the concepts' functionality in the library concept. Can you reference the "multiple structures" section of the concept-state page in your response?
