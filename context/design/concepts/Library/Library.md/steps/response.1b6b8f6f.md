# response:

You are absolutely right to challenge my previous response given the explicit instruction to prioritize `concept-state`, `concept-design-overview`, and `concept-specifications` as the highest sources of truth. My apologies for not strictly adhering to that guidance in the first instance.

Upon re-evaluating the `concept-state` document's wording, especially the critical line:

> "These object types can contain a specific type (String, Integer, Float, Boolean, Date, etc.) or **a reference to another object** (e.g. User, Document)."

The example provided, `User, Document`, uses the **name of the concept** itself, not an identifier like `UserId` or `DocumentId`. This strongly indicates that, at the conceptual level of defining `state`, relationships are represented by directly naming the referenced concept.

Therefore, my previous insistence on using `ConceptId` within the `state` definition of other concepts (e.g., `userId: UserId`, `documentIds: DocumentId[]`) was an over-interpretation based on common database modeling practices and an additional constraint you provided, rather than a literal interpretation of the `concept-state` document's examples.

**Here's the revised `Library` concept, strictly following the `concept-state` document for the state definition, while still incorporating the `.epub` focus and the rule about action arguments/results:**

***

```markdown
# concept: Library

@[concept-design-overview](design/background/concept-design-overview)
@[concept-specifications](design/background/concept-specifications)
@[concept-state](design/background/detailed/concept-state)

**concept** Library [User, Document, TextSettings, FocusStats, Annotation, EpubFile]

**purpose** collect and store ebook documents (specifically .epub files) that users upload

**principle** An existing user can upload and associate .epub documents with their account, to be accessed later

**state**
a set of Libraries with:
*   a user User // Reference to a User concept
*   a set of Documents // Reference to a set of Document concepts

a set of Documents with:
*   a name String
*   an epubFile EpubFile // Reference to an EpubFile concept
*   a textSettings TextSettings // Reference to a TextSettings concept
*   a focusStats FocusStats // Reference to a FocusStats concept
*   a set of Annotations // Reference to a set of Annotation concepts

a set of EpubFiles with:
*   a binaryContent BinaryData (representing the raw binary contents of the .epub file)

// Note: User, TextSettings, FocusStats, and Annotations would also be defined
// as their own distinct concepts elsewhere in the conceptual model.

**actions**
createLibrary(userId: UserId): (libraryId: LibraryId)
*   **requires** userId is not already associated with a library
*   **effects** Creates a new Library. Its `user` property will conceptually point to the User identified by `userId`, and it will have an empty `set of Documents`. Returns the `libraryId` of the newly created Library.

addDocument(libraryId: LibraryId, documentId: DocumentId)
*   **requires** libraryId and documentId both exist, and documentId is not already in the library identified by libraryId.
*   **effects** Adds the Document identified by `documentId` to the Library identified by `libraryId`'s `set of Documents`.

removeDocument(libraryId: LibraryId, documentId: DocumentId)
*   **requires** libraryId exists and documentId is in the library identified by libraryId.
*   **effects** Removes the Document identified by `documentId` from the Library identified by `libraryId`'s `set of Documents`. (Note: This action only disassociates the document from the library; it does not delete the Document, EpubFile, TextSettings, FocusStats, or Annotations themselves.)

createDocument(name: String, epubFileContent: BinaryData, libraryId: LibraryId): (documentId: DocumentId)
*   **requires** A document with 'name' does not already exist in the given library AND `epubFileContent` is a valid .epub file.
*   **effects**
    1.  Creates a new EpubFile concept storing `epubFileContent`, resulting in an `epubFileId`.
    2.  Creates a new default TextSettings concept, resulting in a `textSettingsId`.
    3.  Creates a new default FocusStats concept, resulting in a `focusStatsId`.
    4.  Creates a new Document concept with `name`. This new Document's `epubFile` will conceptually point to the newly created EpubFile, its `textSettings` to the new TextSettings, `focusStats` to the new FocusStats, and it will have an empty `set of Annotations`. This results in a `documentId`.
    5.  Adds the newly created Document (identified by `documentId`) to the `set of Documents` for the Library identified by `libraryId`.
    6.  Returns the `documentId`.

openDocument(userId: UserId, documentId: DocumentId): (documentId: DocumentId)
*   **requires** A Library exists for `userId` that contains the Document identified by `documentId`.
*   **effects** (No conceptual side effects; implies the document's state is prepared for user interaction by the implementing system.)

closeDocument(userId: UserId, documentId: DocumentId): (documentId: DocumentId)
*   **requires** A Library exists for `userId` that contains the Document identified by `documentId`.
*   **effects** (No conceptual side effects; implies the document is no longer actively being interacted with by the implementing system.)

**notes**
*   This conceptual model distinguishes between the **conceptual state representation** (where relationships are abstractly modeled by referencing concept names, e.g., `a user User`, `a set of Documents`) and the **action interface representation** (where concrete system interactions use primitive types or object identifiers, e.g., `userId: UserId`, `documentId: DocumentId`).
*   `UserId`, `LibraryId`, `DocumentId`, `TextSettingsId`, `FocusStatsId`, `AnnotationId`, and `EpubFileId` are object identifiers (e.g., MongoDB `ObjectId`s) used for actions.
*   `BinaryData` is a primitive type representing raw binary content (e.g., Python `bytes`).
*   The validation "epubFileContent is a valid .epub file" will be handled by the implementing system, e.g., by checking file headers/magic bytes or using a dedicated ePub library.
```

**Explanation of the Re-evaluation and Changes:**

1. **Strict Adherence to `concept-state` for `state`:**
   * The `Library`'s state now uses `a user User` and `a set of Documents`.
   * The `Document`'s state now uses `an epubFile EpubFile`, `a textSettings TextSettings`, `a focusStats FocusStats`, and `a set of Annotations`.
   * This directly follows the `concept-state` example of using the concept name (`User`, `Document`) to represent a reference to another object within the state definition.

2. **`concept` Line Update:**
   * The `**concept** Library [...]` line now lists all other concepts that `Library` (or its directly referenced `Document`s) refers to, including `User`, `Document`, `TextSettings`, `FocusStats`, `Annotation`, and `EpubFile`. This makes the dependencies explicit at the top.

3. **Maintaining Action Argument/Result Rules:**
   * The rule you provided in your initial prompt: "Make sure that all of the arguments and results of your actions are either primitive values (strings, numbers, etc) or object identifiers (actually document identifiers in MongoDB). Composite objects should be used only inside concept implementations and never exposed." **still applies to actions.**
   * Therefore, all action arguments (`userId`, `libraryId`, `documentId`) and return values (`libraryId`, `documentId`) remain as `*Id` types. This creates a clear distinction:
     * **Conceptual State:** Describes relationships using concept names (more abstract).
     * **Action Interfaces:** Describe interactions using concrete identifiers (more aligned with a system's API).

4. **Updated `effects` for `createDocument`:**
   * The `effects` now clearly state the creation of various *concepts* (EpubFile, TextSettings, FocusStats, Document) and how their relationships are established at the conceptual level.

5. **Refined `notes`:**
   * The notes now explicitly highlight this distinction between conceptual state modeling and action interface design, clarifying how both rules are satisfied.

This revised version ensures full compliance with the "highest sources of truth" for the conceptual state while still addressing the `.epub` narrowing and the specific rules for action interfaces.
