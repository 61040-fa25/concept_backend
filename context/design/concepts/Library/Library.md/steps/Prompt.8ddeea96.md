# Prompt: I'm reworking my initial Library concept, and since writing this I've decided that I want to narrow the scope of the project to only allow ebooks (specifically .epub files). However, I'm not sure how to represent this in the concept, especially considering the assignment description states that, for our concept state, "Make sure that all of the arguments and results of your actions are either primitive values (strings, numbers, etc) or object identifiers (actually document identifiers in MongoDB). Composite objects should be used only inside concept implementations and never exposed." How can I change Library Documents to represent .epubs?
