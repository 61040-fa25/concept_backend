# Prompt: I don't think EpubFile really serves any distinct purpose as a concept rather than a referenced data type that is functionally a primitive. Assuming that we're not arbitrarily changing the binaryData of a epub file except via a library, we are always treating the EpubFile as a primitive with built-in operations that can be acted on it (similar to a String or Array). There aren't any benefits to having the level of granularity provided by BinaryData, and BinaryData itself isn't even a built-in primitive. Do you agree?
