Here's the implementation for the `Library` concept, following the Concept Design principles and the provided TypeScript/MongoDB implementation guidelines.

First, let's specify the concept:

```concept
concept Library [User, Item]

purpose: To enable users to borrow and return items, managing their availability.

principle: If a user borrows an available item, it becomes unavailable and they are recorded as having it;
           if they return it, it becomes available again and they no longer have it.

state:
  a set of LibraryItems with
    title: String
    author: String
    available: Boolean
    borrowedBy: Optional User // null if available
  a set of LibraryUsers with
    name: String
    borrowedItemIds: set of Item // IDs of items currently borrowed by this user

actions:
  registerUser (name: String): (user: User)
  createItem (title: String, author: String): (item: Item)
  borrowItem (user: User, item: Item): (error: String)
  returnItem (user: User, item: Item): (error: String)

queries:
  _getAvailableItems (): (item: Item, title: String, author: String)
  _getBorrowedItemsByUser (user: User): (item: Item, title: String, author: String)
  _getUserBorrowCount (user: User): (count: Number)
```

Now, the TypeScript implementation:
