# trace:

The trace for the operational principle "it presents the currently scheduled task to the user, providing a single point of focus" demonstrates the core functionality:

1. **Initial State**: A user (`userA`) exists but has no focus task. We confirm this by calling `getCurrentTask({ user: userA })`, which is expected to return an empty object `{}`. This represents a user who has not yet decided what to work on.

2. **Action `setCurrentTask`**: The user decides to focus on a task (`task1`). We call `setCurrentTask({ user: userA, task: task1 })`. The action succeeds and returns an empty object `{}`, indicating the state has been updated.

3. **Effect Verification**: The `effect` of the action is that the user's current focus is now set. We verify this by calling `getCurrentTask({ user: userA })` again. This time, it is expected to return an object containing the task that was just set: `{ task: "task:1" }`.

This sequence validates that the concept correctly associates a task with a user and allows that association to be retrieved, fulfilling its principle of providing a single point of focus.
