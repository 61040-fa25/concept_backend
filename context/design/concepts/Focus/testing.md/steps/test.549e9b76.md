# test: Write tests for the implementation of Focus making sure you follow the assignment guidelines:

**Testing concepts**. Your tests should cover the basic behavior of the concept but should also include some more interesting cases. Your tests should use the Deno testing framework and should be programmatic (that is, determining in the code whether they succeeded or failed, and not requiring a human to interpret console messages). They should also print helpful messages to the console with action inputs and outputs so that a human reader can make sense of the test execution when it runs in the console. Some more details about the test cases you should include:

* **Operational principle**. A sequence of action executions that corresponds to the operational principle, representing the common expected usage of the concept. These sequence is not required to use all the actions; operational principles often do not include a deletion action, for example.
* **Interesting scenarios**. Sequences of action executions that correspond to less common cases: probing interesting corners of the functionality, undoing actions with deletions and cancellations, repeating actions with the same arguments, etc. In some of these scenarios actions may be expected to throw errors.
* **Number required**. For each concept, you should have one test sequence for the operational principle, and 3-5 additional interesting scenarios. Every action should be executed successfully in at least one of the scenarios.
* **No state setup**. Your test cases should not require any setting up of the concept state except by calling concept actions. When you are testing one action at a time, this means that you will want to order your actions carefully (for example, by the operational principle) to avoid having to set up state.
* **Saving test execution output**. Save the test execution output by copy-pasting from the console to a markdown file.

Here is the implementation:

```typescript
import { Collection, Db } from "npm:mongodb";

import { Empty, ID } from "@utils/types.ts";

  

// Define generic type parameters for this concept

type User = ID;

type Task = ID;

  

// Define the prefix for MongoDB collections to namespace them for this concept

const PREFIX = "Focus.";

  

/**

 * Represents the state of the Focus concept.

 * Maps a User to their single current Task.

 */

interface CurrentTaskDoc {

  _id: User;

  task: Task;

}

  

/**

 * Focus Concept

 *

 * @purpose To eliminate decision fatigue by presenting the single task a user should be working on right now.

 * @principle It presents the currently scheduled task to the user, providing a single point of focus.

 */

export default class FocusConcept {

  private readonly currentTasks: Collection<CurrentTaskDoc>;

  

  constructor(private readonly db: Db) {

    this.currentTasks = this.db.collection<CurrentTaskDoc>(

      PREFIX + "currentTasks",

    );

  }

  

  /**

   * Sets the specified task as the user's current focus.

   * If the user already has a focus task, it is replaced.

   *

   * @param user The ID of the user.

   * @param task The ID of the task to set as the focus.

   * @returns An empty object on success.

   */

  async setCurrentTask(

    { user, task }: { user: User; task: Task },

  ): Promise<Empty> {

    // This action can always be performed.

    // requires: true

  

    // effects: sets the specified task as the user's current focus

    await this.currentTasks.updateOne(

      { _id: user },

      { $set: { task: task } },

      { upsert: true },

    );

    return {};

  }

  

  /**

   * Removes the current task for the user, leaving them with no focus.

   *

   * @param user The ID of the user whose focus should be cleared.

   * @returns An empty object on success.

   */

  async clearCurrentTask({ user }: { user: User }): Promise<Empty> {

    // This action can always be performed.

    // requires: true

  

    // effects: removes the current task for the user

    await this.currentTasks.deleteOne({ _id: user });

    return {};

  }

  

  /**

   * Returns the user's current task, if one is set.

   *

   * @param user The ID of the user.

   * @returns An object containing the task ID if found, otherwise an empty object.

   */

  async getCurrentTask({ user }: { user: User }): Promise<{ task?: Task }> {

    // This action can always be performed.

    // requires: true

  

    // effects: returns the user's current task, if any

    const doc = await this.currentTasks.findOne({ _id: user });

    if (doc) {

      return { task: doc.task };

    }

    return {};

  }

}
