# Documentation

Every concept should have inline documentation and commenting:

* The concept itself should be paired with its purpose.
* The state should be described next to any types.
* Any testing should be guided by the principle.
* Each action should state the requirements and effects, and tests should check that both work against variations.

`concept Focus [User, Task]
  purpose to eliminate decision fatigue by presenting the single task a user should be working on right now
  principle it presents the currently scheduled task to the user, providing a single point of focus
  state
    a CurrentTask element of User with
      a task Task
  actions
    setCurrentTask (user: User, task: Task)
      effect sets the specified task as the user's current focus
    clearCurrentTask (user: User)
      effect removes the current task for the user
    getCurrentTask (user: User): (task: optional Task)
      effect returns the user's current task, if any`
