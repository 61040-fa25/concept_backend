ProgressTrackingConcept: Principle Test - Full Lifecycle ...
\------- output -------

--- ðŸš€ Principle Test: Create, Add, Modify, Reach Goal, Remove, Delete ---
Principle: A plan breaks a tripâ€™s cost into manageable contributions, the user sets a payment period and the amount to be paid every period. The user can also change those details for some trip.

Action: createPlan (user: 0199ed80, trip: 0199ed80, period: 12, amountPer: 100, goal: 1200)
Effect: âœ… New plan created with ID: 0199ed80, with initial period 12, amount 100
Query: âœ… updateGoalStatus -> Verified initial goalReachedFlag: false

Action: addAmount (user: 0199ed80, plan: 0199ed80, amount: 300)
Effect: âœ… Amount $300 added to plan, new currentAmount: 300
Query: âœ… updateGoalStatus -> Verified goalReachedFlag is false.

Action: modifyPlan (user: 0199ed80, plan: 0199ed80, newPeriod: 6, newAmountPer: 200)
Effect: âœ… Plan payment details changed. (Cannot query paymentPeriod/amountPerPeriod directly via _getPlans, as it only returns IDs).

Action: addAmount (user: 0199ed80, plan: 0199ed80, amount: 900)
Effect: âœ… Added $900 to reach goal, new currentAmount: 1200
Query: ðŸŽ‰ updateGoalStatus -> Verified goalReachedFlag is true.

Action: removeAmount (user: 0199ed80, plan: 0199ed80, amount: 50)
Effect: âœ… Amount $50 removed from plan, new currentAmount: 1150
Query: âœ… updateGoalStatus -> Verified goalReachedFlag is false after falling below goal.

Action: deletePlan (user: 0199ed80, plan: 0199ed80)
Effect: âœ… Plan deleted
Query: âœ… _getPlans -> User's plans after deletion: []
