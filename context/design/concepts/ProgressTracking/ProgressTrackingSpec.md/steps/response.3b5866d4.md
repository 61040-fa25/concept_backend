# response:

You've hit on a crucial point of potential ambiguity in the concept! Let's break down the comment and your idea based on the provided `ProgressTracking` concept.

First, let's address your specific statement: **"My idea behind goalAmount and paymentPeriod is that they're essentially independent of each other, goalAmount is the amount paid each paymentPeriod."**

There's a misunderstanding in the second part of this statement:

* **`goalAmount` is *not* the amount paid each `paymentPeriod`.**
  * The concept explicitly defines `amountPerPeriod` as "the amount to be paid every period."
  * The common understanding of "goal amount" in a savings plan is the **total target amount** that the user intends to save *towards*.

So, if we correct that misunderstanding, `goalAmount` should represent the *total amount* the user is trying to save, while `amountPerPeriod` is the *installment* they pay at each `paymentPeriod`.

***

Now, let's address the commenter's question: **"Is goalAmount in ProgressTracking dependent on paymentPeriod and amountPerPeriod? If so, it should be a part of your requires clause to enforce the relationship between them."**

Based on the current concept:

1. **`goalAmount` is currently *not* mathematically dependent on `paymentPeriod` and `amountPerPeriod` in the sense of being *derived* from them.**
   * When you `createPlan`, `goalAmount`, `paymentPeriod`, and `amountPerPeriod` are all provided as **independent input parameters**. There's no instruction that `goalAmount` must be a product or sum of the others.
   * The `modifyPlan` action only allows changing `newPaymentPeriod` and `newAmountPerPeriod`, but *not* `goalAmount`. This reinforces the idea that `goalAmount` is a fixed target set at creation, independent of the ongoing payment schedule.

2. **Therefore, based purely on the current *syntax* of the concept, there is no inherent relationship between `goalAmount`, `paymentPeriod`, and `amountPerPeriod` that needs to be enforced in a `requires` clause *between these three attributes*.**

***

**However, there's a strong *implied* relationship that the concept *should* clarify and potentially enforce:**

* **The purpose statement:** "create and track savings plans for discretionary vacation goals"
* **The principle statement:** "a plan breaks a tripâ€™s cost into manageable contributions..."
* **The `trip` attribute:** `trip` **TripCostEstimation**

These strongly suggest that `goalAmount` *should* be the **total cost of the `trip`** (or at least related to it).

**Recommendation for improving the concept:**

1. **Clarify the definition of `goalAmount`:** Explicitly state that `goalAmount` is the *total target amount to be saved for the trip*. This will resolve the confusion about it being "amount paid each period."

2. **Consider enforcing the relationship between `goalAmount` and `trip.cost` (if `TripCostEstimation` has such an attribute).**
   * If `goalAmount` is *intended* to be the exact total cost of the trip, then you *should* add a `requires` clause to `createPlan`:
     ```
     createPlan (user: User, trip: TripCostEstimation, paymentPeriod: Number, amountPerPeriod: Number, goalAmount: Number): (plan: Plan)
     * requires goalAmount equals trip.totalCost (assuming TripCostEstimation has a totalCost attribute)
     * requires amountPerPeriod is the amount that the user selects to pay every paymentPeriod month
     * effect makes a new plan linked to `trip` and `user`
     ```
   * **Why this makes sense:** If `goalAmount` is truly the `trip`'s cost, then it *is* dependent on the `trip` object and should not be an arbitrary number passed in independently. This also simplifies the `createPlan` signature if you can derive `goalAmount` from `trip`. E.g., `createPlan (user: User, trip: TripCostEstimation, paymentPeriod: Number, amountPerPeriod: Number)` and the system automatically sets `goalAmount = trip.totalCost`.

3. **If `goalAmount` can be different from `trip.cost` (e.g., saving for only a portion of the trip, or saving more than the trip's cost):**
   * Then keep `goalAmount` as an independent input to `createPlan`.
   * But still, clearly define `goalAmount` as the *total target savings* to avoid confusion with `amountPerPeriod`.
   * In this scenario, there's no mathematical dependency between `goalAmount`, `paymentPeriod`, and `amountPerPeriod` that needs a `requires` clause *between them*. They are all independent parameters defining different aspects of the plan.

**In summary:**

Your original idea that `goalAmount` and `paymentPeriod` are "essentially independent of each other" (as input parameters) is correct according to the current concept structure. However, your statement that "goalAmount is the amount paid each paymentPeriod" is incorrect; that role belongs to `amountPerPeriod`.

The commenter's suggestion highlights a valid point about clarifying relationships. While `goalAmount` isn't dependent on `paymentPeriod` and `amountPerPeriod`, it *should* likely be dependent on the `trip`'s cost, and that's the `requires` clause you might want to add.
