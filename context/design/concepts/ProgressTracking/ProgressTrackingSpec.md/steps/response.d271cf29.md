# response:

You've identified a very important missing piece for a robust savings tracking system! Adding a `goalReachedFlag` and an action to manage it significantly enhances the utility of `ProgressTracking`.

Here's how we can integrate this into the concept:

### Updated ProgressTracking \[TripCostEstimation, User]

* **purpose** create and track savings plans for discretionary vacation goals
* **principle** a plan breaks a tripâ€™s cost into manageable contributions, the user sets a payment period and the amount to be paid every period. The user can also change those details for some trip.
* **state**
  * a set of **Users** with
    * a set of **Plans**
  * a set of **Plans** with
    * a `trip` **TripCostEstimation**
    * a `paymentPeriod` **Number**
    * a `amountPerPeriod` **Number**
    * a `goalAmount` **Number**
    * a `currentAmount` **Number**
    * **NEW:** a `goalReachedFlag` **Boolean**
* **actions**
  * `createPlan (user: User, trip: TripCostEstimation, paymentPeriod: Number, amountPerPeriod: Number, goalAmount: Number): (plan: Plan)`
    * **requires** amountPerPeriod is the amount that the user selects to pay every paymentPeriod month
    * **effect** makes a new plan linked to `trip` and `user`. Sets `currentAmount` to `0`. Sets `goalReachedFlag` to `false` (unless `goalAmount` is 0 or negative, in which case it would be `true` from the start).
    * *Refinement for clarity:* `goalReachedFlag` is initialized to `(0 >= goalAmount)`.
  * `addAmount (user: User, plan: Plan, amount: Number)`
    * **requires** plan exists and belongs to user
    * **effect** increases `currentAmount` of plan by `amount` and then calls `updateGoalStatus(user, plan)`. Returns `currentAmount`.
  * `removeAmount (user: User, plan: Plan, amount: Number)`
    * **requires** plan exists and belongs to user and amount less than or equal to currentAmount associated with plan
    * **effect** decreases `currentAmount` by `amount` and then calls `updateGoalStatus(user, plan)`.
  * `deletePlan (user: User, plan: Plan)`
    * **requires** `plan` exists and belongs to user
    * **effect** removes plan
  * `modifyPlan (user: User, plan: Plan, newPaymentPeriod: Number, newAmountPerPeriod: Number)`
    * **requires** plan exists and belongs to user
    * **effect** updates savings schedule associated with plan by changing the `paymentPeriod` to `newPaymentPeriod` and `amountPerPeriod` to `newAmountPerPeriod`.
  * **NEW ACTION:** `updateGoalStatus (user: User, plan: Plan)`
    * **purpose** To check if the savings goal has been met or surpassed and update the `goalReachedFlag`.
    * **requires** `plan` exists and belongs to `user`.
    * **effect**
      * If `plan.currentAmount >= plan.goalAmount`, sets `plan.goalReachedFlag` to `true`.
      * Otherwise (`plan.currentAmount < plan.goalAmount`), sets `plan.goalReachedFlag` to `false`.

**Justification for the changes:**

1. **`goalReachedFlag` in State:** This directly addresses the prompt, providing a clear indicator of the plan's status.
2. **Initialization in `createPlan`:** It's crucial that `goalReachedFlag` has an initial state. Setting it based on the initial `currentAmount` (which is 0) and `goalAmount` ensures logical consistency from the moment of plan creation.
3. **Integration into `addAmount` and `removeAmount`:** While `updateGoalStatus` is a distinct action, its primary purpose is to reflect changes in `currentAmount`. Therefore, it's best practice to call this check automatically whenever `currentAmount` changes. This ensures the `goalReachedFlag` is always up-to-date without requiring manual intervention from a user or another system process.
4. **New `updateGoalStatus` Action:** This action encapsulates the logic for checking and setting the flag, making the concept modular and easy to understand. It can also be called explicitly if there's a need to re-evaluate the status without a change in `currentAmount` (e.g., if `goalAmount` itself were allowed to be modified, which it currently isn't in `modifyPlan`).

This update makes the `ProgressTracking` concept more comprehensive and actionable, fulfilling the tracking aspect of its purpose.
