You're absolutely right! Each logical test scenario should ideally be its own `Deno.test` block for better isolation, clarity, and more granular reporting.

Here's the refactored test file where each step from the previous "purpose" test, and each of the new "interesting situations" are now individual `Deno.test` blocks. This ensures that the database is fresh for every single test case.
