# response:

To implement the `Ranking` concept, we will define its TypeScript class, ensuring all specified actions and queries are correctly translated. The concept state, described as a map from `User` to `UserRanking` (which is a set of `RankedSong`), will be represented as a MongoDB collection where each document's `_id` is the `User` ID, and it contains an array of `RankedSong` objects.

We will use a simple scoring mechanism: when a comparison is made, the preferred song's score increases by `SCORE_ADJUSTMENT`, and the other song's score decreases by the same amount, clamped between `MIN_SCORE` and `MAX_SCORE`. New songs are initialized with a `DEFAULT_SCORE`.
