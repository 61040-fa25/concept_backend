# response:

To implement the `Reaction` concept, we'll create a TypeScript file `src/concepts/Reaction/ReactionConcept.ts`. This implementation will adhere to the provided guidelines for state management with MongoDB, action/query signatures, error handling, and documentation.

### file: src/concepts/Reaction/ReactionConcept.ts

```typescript
import { Collection, Db } from "npm:mongodb";
import { Empty, ID } from "@utils/types.ts";
import { freshID } from "@utils/database.ts";

// Declare collection prefix, using the concept name
const PREFIX = "Reaction" + ".";

// Generic types defined by the concept specification
type Post = ID;
type User = ID;
type EmojiString = string; // As per the prompt's "Using only what is above", EmojiString is treated as a plain string.
                           // No specific emoji validation function is provided in the document.
type UUID = ID; // The concept spec uses UUID for entity identifiers, which maps directly to our 'ID' type.

/**
 * Interface representing a single Reaction entity as stored in MongoDB.
 * Corresponds to:
 * "a set of Reaction with
 * id: UUID
 * post: Post
 * reactionType: EmojiString
 * reactingUser: User"
 */
interface ReactionDocument {
  _id: UUID; // MongoDB's primary key, corresponding to 'id' in the concept spec
  post: Post;
  reactionType: EmojiString;
  reactingUser: User;
}

/**
 * Concept: Reaction
 * Purpose: allow users to respond to posts with lightweight emoji feedback
 *
 * Implements the Reaction concept for managing emoji-based user reactions to posts.
 * It ensures that users can add and remove specific emoji reactions to posts,
 * and allows querying these reactions by post or by post and user.
 */
export default class ReactionConcept {
  // MongoDB collection for storing Reaction entities
  reactions: Collection<ReactionDocument>;

  constructor(private readonly db: Db) {
    this.reactions = this.db.collection(PREFIX + "reactions");
  }

  /**
   * add (post: Post, reactionType: EmojiString, reactingUser: User) : (reactionId: UUID)
   *

   * // 1. reactionType IS_VALID_EMOJI (As per the prompt, this is treated as string validity; no specific validation logic is applied here.)
   * // 2. User cannot add the exact same emoji reaction to the same post twice
   * AND NOT (EXISTS r IN Reaction SUCH THAT r.post == post AND r.reactingUser == reactingUser AND r.reactionType == reactionType)
   *
   * **effects** create new_reaction with id = UUID(), post = post, reactionType = reactionType, reactingUser = reactingUser
   * add new_reaction to Reaction
