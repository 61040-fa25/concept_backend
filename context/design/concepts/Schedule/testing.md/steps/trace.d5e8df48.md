# trace:

The following trace demonstrates the operational principle: a user's schedule is initialized by syncing with an external calendar, and then further customized with a manually added time block.

1. **Start State**: User `user:Alice` has no `BusySlot` documents in the database.
2. **Action**: `_getSlots({ user: "user:Alice" })` is called.
   * **Result**: Returns an empty array `[]`.
   * **State Change**: None.
3. **Action**: `syncCalendar({ user: "user:Alice", externalEvents: [...] })` is called with two events.
   * **Requires**: `user` is provided. This is met. `externalEvents` have valid `startTime` < `endTime`. This is met.
   * **Effects**: Deletes any existing slots for `user:Alice` (there are none). Then, it creates two new `BusySlot` documents in the `schedule.busySlots` collection, one for each event.
   * **Result**: Returns an empty object `{}` indicating success.
   * **State Change**: The collection now contains two documents owned by `user:Alice`.
4. **Action**: `_getSlots({ user: "user:Alice" })` is called again to verify the state.
   * **Result**: Returns an array with two `BusySlot` objects, matching the events from the sync.
   * **State Change**: None.
5. **Action**: `blockTime({ user: "user:Alice", startTime: ..., endTime: ... })` is called to add a lunch break.
   * **Requires**: `user`, `startTime`, and `endTime` are provided, and `startTime` < `endTime`. This is met.
   * **Effects**: Creates one new `BusySlot` document in the collection.
   * **Result**: Returns `{ _id: "..." }` with the ID of the new slot.
   * **State Change**: The collection now contains three documents owned by `user:Alice`.
6. **Action**: `_getSlots({ user: "user:Alice" })` is called a final time.
   * **Result**: Returns an array with three `BusySlot` objects.
   * **State Change**: None.

This trace confirms that the concept successfully models its principle by allowing an initial state to be set via an external source (`syncCalendar`) and then modified with specific, user-initiated actions (`blockTime`), with the state being queryable at each step (`_getSlots`).
