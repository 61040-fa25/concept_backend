# Documentation

Every concept should have inline documentation and commenting:

* The concept itself should be paired with its purpose.
* The state should be described next to any types.
* Any testing should be guided by the principle.
* Each action should state the requirements and effects, and tests should check that both work against variations.

concept Schedule \[User]
purpose to represent a user's availability by combining non-negotiable, externally-scheduled commitments with manual time blocks
principle The schedule shows a read-only reflection of a user's external calendar, and gives options to add and edit manual time blocks.

state
a set of BusySlots with
an owner User
a startTime DateTime
a endTime DateTime
a description String
an origin: (EXTERNAL, MANUAL)

actions
blockTime (user: User, startTime: DateTime, endTime: DateTime, description: String)
effect creates a new BusySlot for the user with the given details and sets origin to MANUAL
updateSlot (slot: BusySlot, newStartTime: DateTime, newEndTime: DateTime, newDescription: String)
requires slot.origin is MANUAL
effect modifies the properties of a manually created BusySlot
deleteSlot (slot: BusySlot)
requires slot.origin is MANUAL
effect removes a manually created BusySlot
syncCalendar (user: User, externalEvents: set of Events)
effect updates the user's schedule to match their external calendar without affecting MANUAL blocks.
deleteAllForUser (user: User)
effect removes all busy slots (both MANUAL and EXTERNAL) for the user.
getSlots (user: User): (slots: set of BusySlots)
effect returns all busy slots for the user, regardless of origin
