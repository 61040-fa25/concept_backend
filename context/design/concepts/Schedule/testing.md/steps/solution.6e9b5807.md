# solution:

To fix this, we need to provide valid time inputs to the `updateSlot` call within the test case, ensuring that `newStartTime` is strictly before `newEndTime`. This will allow the action to pass the initial time validation and proceed to the origin check, which is the actual behavior this test is designed to verify.
