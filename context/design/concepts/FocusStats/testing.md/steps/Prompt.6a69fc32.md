# Prompt: I'm getting a weird error, the line "import FocusStatsConcept from "./FocusStatsConcept.ts"" is saying that there's an error because ./FocusStatsConcept.ts has no default export, even though I see the line with export default class... Additionally, it gives the following Error with a red squiggly under the "./FocusStatsConcept.ts": Already included file name 'file:///C:/Users/Ryan/OneDrive/Documents/MIT/F25%20Classes/6.1040/FocusReader/src/concepts/FocusStats/FocusStatsConcept.ts' differs from file name 'file:///C:/Users/Ryan/OneDrive/Documents/MIT/F25%20Classes/6.1040/FocusReader/src/concepts/FocusStats/focusStatsConcept.ts' only in casing.  The file is in the program because: Imported via "./FocusStatsConcept.ts" from file 'file:///C:/Users/Ryan/OneDrive/Documents/MIT/F25%20Classes/6.1040/FocusReader/src/concepts/FocusStats/FocusStatsConcept.test.ts'. I did formerly (incorrectly) name the file with a lower case f, but I since remedied that.
