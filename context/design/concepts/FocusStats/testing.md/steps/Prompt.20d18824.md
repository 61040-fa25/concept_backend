# Prompt: The bug came back, it's no longer saying there's no default import, but it is giving the same error about differing by a case (copied below). Why is the file in the program? I don't understand the "imported via" line

Already included file name 'file:///C:/Users/Ryan/OneDrive/Documents/MIT/F25%20Classes/6.1040/FocusReader/src/concepts/FocusStats/FocusStatsConcept.ts' differs from file name 'file:///C:/Users/Ryan/OneDrive/Documents/MIT/F25%20Classes/6.1040/FocusReader/src/concepts/FocusStats/focusStatsConcept.ts' only in casing.\
The file is in the program because:\
Imported via "./FocusStatsConcept.ts" from file 'file:///C:/Users/Ryan/OneDrive/Documents/MIT/F25%20Classes/6.1040/FocusReader/src/concepts/FocusStats/FocusStatsConcept.test.ts'\
Root file specified for compilation
