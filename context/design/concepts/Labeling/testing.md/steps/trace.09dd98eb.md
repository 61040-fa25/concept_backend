### Operational Principle Fulfillment Trace

1. **Initial State**: No labels exist, no items are labeled.
2. **`createLabel({ name: "Urgent" })`**: A new label named "Urgent" is created in the `labelsCollection` with a unique internal ID (e.g., `label:xyz`) and an empty `items` array.
3. **`createLabel({ name: "Important" })`**: A new label named "Important" is created with its own internal ID (e.g., `label:abc`).
4. **`addLabel({ item: "item:article_123", labelName: "Urgent" })`**:
   * The concept finds the internal ID for "Urgent" (`label:xyz`).
   * Since "item:article\_123" does not exist in `itemsCollection`, a new `ItemDoc` is created: `_id: "item:article_123", labels: ["label:xyz"]`.
   * The `labelsCollection` document for `label:xyz` ("Urgent") is updated to include "item:article\_123" in its `items` array.
5. **`addLabel({ item: "item:image_456", labelName: "Urgent" })`**:
   * The concept finds `label:xyz` for "Urgent".
   * Since "item:image\_456" does not exist, a new `ItemDoc` is created: `_id: "item:image_456", labels: ["label:xyz"]`.
   * The `labelsCollection` document for `label:xyz` ("Urgent") is updated to include "item:image\_456" in its `items` array.
6. **`_getLabelItems({ labelName: "Urgent" })`**: Queries the `labelsCollection` for the "Urgent" label, retrieves its `items` array, returning `["item:article_123", "item:image_456"]`.
7. **`_getItemLabels({ item: "item:article_123" })`**: Queries the `itemsCollection` for "item:article\_123", retrieves its `labels` array, returning `["label:xyz"]`.
8. **`deleteLabel({ item: "item:article_123", labelName: "Urgent" })`**:
   * The concept finds `label:xyz` for "Urgent".
   * The `itemsCollection` document for "item:article\_123" is updated to remove `label:xyz` from its `labels` array, resulting in `labels: []`.
   * The `labelsCollection` document for `label:xyz` ("Urgent") is updated to remove "item:article\_123" from its `items` array.
9. **`_getLabelItems({ labelName: "Urgent" })`**: Queries the `labelsCollection` for "Urgent", retrieves its `items` array, now returning `["item:image_456"]`.
10. **`_getItemLabels({ item: "item:article_123" })`**: Queries the `itemsCollection` for "item:article\_123", retrieves its `labels` array, now returning `[]`.
11. **Final State**: "Urgent" label is associated only with "item:image\_456". "item:article\_123" has no labels. "Important" label exists but is not associated with any items.
