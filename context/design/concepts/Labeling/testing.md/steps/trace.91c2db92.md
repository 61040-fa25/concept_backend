### Principle Trace: User Alice's Note Management and Flashcard Generation

This trace demonstrates the core functionality outlined in the `Notes` concept's principle: storing notes, converting them to flashcards, and removing them.

1. **`addNotes` (user: `user:Alice`, name: `"Math Facts"`, content: `"1 + 1 = 2; 2 * 2 = 4."`)**
   * **Requires**: No existing note for `user:Alice` named "Math Facts".
   * **Effects**: A new note document is inserted into the `Notes.notes` collection:
     ```json
     {
       "_id": "someFreshId1",
       "user": "user:Alice",
       "name": "Math Facts",
       "content": "1 + 1 = 2; 2 * 2 = 4."
     }
     ```
   * **Returns**: `{}` (success)

2. **`_getNotes` (user: `user:Alice`, name: `"Math Facts"`)**
   * **Requires**: A note exists for `user:Alice` named "Math Facts".
   * **Effects**: Queries the `Notes.notes` collection.
   * **Returns**: `["1 + 1 = 2; 2 * 2 = 4."]`

3. **`addNotes` (user: `user:Alice`, name: `"Physics Concepts"`, content: `"Newton's First Law: An object at rest stays at rest."`)**
   * **Requires**: No existing note for `user:Alice` named "Physics Concepts".
   * **Effects**: A new note document is inserted into the `Notes.notes` collection:
     ```json
     {
       "_id": "someFreshId2",
       "user": "user:Alice",
       "name": "Physics Concepts",
       "content": "Newton's First Law: An object at rest stays at rest."
     }
     ```
   * **Returns**: `{}` (success)

4. **`_getNotes` (user: `user:Alice`, name: `"Physics Concepts"`)**
   * **Requires**: A note exists for `user:Alice` named "Physics Concepts".
   * **Effects**: Queries the `Notes.notes` collection.
   * **Returns**: `["Newton's First Law: An object at rest stays at rest."]`

5. **`notesToFlashCards` (user: `user:Alice`, name: `"Math Facts"`)**
   * **Requires**: A note exists for `user:Alice` named "Math Facts".
   * **Effects**:
     * Retrieves the content of "Math Facts" from the `Notes.notes` collection.
     * Mocks the `GeminiLLM` to return a predefined flashcard JSON.
     * Parses the LLM response into `Flashcard` objects.
   * **Returns**:
     ```json
     {
       "cards": [
         { "question": "What is 1 + 1?", "answer": "2" },
         { "question": "What is 2 * 2?", "answer": "4" }
       ]
     }
     ```

6. **`removeNotes` (user: `user:Alice`, name: `"Physics Concepts"`)**
   * **Requires**: A note exists for `user:Alice` named "Physics Concepts".
   * **Effects**: The note document with `_id: "someFreshId2"` (for "Physics Concepts") is deleted from the `Notes.notes` collection.
   * **Returns**: `{}` (success)

7. **`_getNotes` (user: `user:Alice`, name: `"Physics Concepts"`)**
   * **Requires**: A note exists for `user:Alice` named "Physics Concepts".
   * **Effects**: Queries the `Notes.notes` collection.
   * **Returns**: `{ error: "No note with name 'Physics Concepts' found for user 'user:Alice'." }` (as the note was removed)

This trace successfully demonstrates the sequential interaction with the `Notes` concept, fulfilling its stated purpose and principle.
