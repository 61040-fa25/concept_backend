Here's a stylized version of your test output:

🧪 Running test: PasswordAuthenticationConcept: register() - Fails when username already exists (requires) ...

\--- Action Test: register() - Fails with existing username ---

✅ Step 1: Registering user 'duplicateUser' for the first time.
✨ Effect: User 'duplicateUser' registered.

➡️ Step 2: Attempting to register user 'duplicateUser' again.
🚫 Action: register({ username: "duplicateUser", password: "..." })
🛑 Requirement Confirmation: The 'username' must not already exist in Users. This requirement was *not met*, and the action correctly failed with the expected error: 'User with username 'duplicateUser' already exists.'.

🎉 Test Result: PasswordAuthenticationConcept: register() - Fails when username already exists (requires) ... ✅ PASSED! (1s)
