PasswordAuthenticationConcept: Principle - User registers and then authenticates successfully ...
\------- output -------

\--- Principle Test: Demonstrate User Registration and Authentication Flow ---
Trace: Step 1 - Attempting to register user 'principleUser'.
Action: register({ username: "principleUser", password: "..." })
Effect: User 'principleUser' registered successfully with ID: 0199eaa4-98ae-72f6-8074-2d903db54869.
Trace: Step 2 - Attempting to authenticate user 'principleUser'.
Action: authenticate({ username: "principleUser", password: "..." })
Effect: User 'principleUser' successfully authenticated. Returned User ID matches registered ID.
Principle alignment: This sequence of actions demonstrates that a user can register with a username and password, and subsequently authenticate using those exact credentials, confirming the core principle of the concept.
