--- Interesting Case: Multiple Independent Users (with _getAllUsers check) ---
Trace: Step 1 - Registering User A ('userAlice').
  Effect: User A registered with ID: 0199f463-c569-7e09-8a6f-c5d58ebc6aab.
Trace: Step 2 - Registering User B ('userBob1').
  Effect: User B registered with ID: 0199f463-c5dc-7fa3-800c-f7481d9efabf.
  Effect Confirmation: Distinct User IDs were generated for different users.
Trace: Step 3 - Authenticating User A ('userAlice').
  Effect: User A authenticated successfully.
Trace: Step 4 - Authenticating User B ('userBob1').
  Effect: User B authenticated successfully.
Trace: Step 5 - Querying for all registered users.
  Effect Confirmation: _getAllUsers correctly listed all registered user IDs: [0199f463-c569-7e09-8a6f-c5d58ebc6aab, 0199f463-c5dc-7fa3-800c-f7481d9efabf].
Interesting case fulfilled: This demonstrates that the concept correctly handles multiple independent users, allowing each to register and authenticate without interference, and that all registered users are retrievable by ID through the _getAllUsers query, aligning with expected multi-user system behavior and query functionality.
----- output end -----
PasswordAuthenticationConcept: Multiple distinct users can register and authenticate independently, and be listed ... ok (1s)
