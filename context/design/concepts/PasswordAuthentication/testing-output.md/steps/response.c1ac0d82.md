🧪 Running 6 tests from ./src/concepts/PasswordAuthentication/PasswordAuthenticationConcept.test.ts

***

**1. PasswordAuthenticationConcept: register() - Fails when username already exists (requires)**

\--- Action Test: register() - Fails with existing username ---

✅ Step 1: Registering user 'duplicateUser' for the first time.
✨ Effect: User 'duplicateUser' registered.

➡️ Step 2: Attempting to register user 'duplicateUser' again with a different password.
🚫 Action: register({ username: "duplicateUser", password: "..." })
🛑 Requirement Confirmation: The 'username' must not already exist in Users. This requirement was *not met*, and the action correctly failed with the expected error: 'User with username 'duplicateUser' already exists.'.

🎉 Test Result: PasswordAuthenticationConcept: register() - Fails when username already exists (requires) ... ✅ PASSED! (1s)

***

**2. PasswordAuthenticationConcept: register() - Fails with password shorter than 8 characters (requires)**

\--- Action Test: register() - Fails with short password ---

➡️ Attempting to register user 'shortPassUser' with a short password.
🚫 Action: register({ username: "shortPassUser", password: "short" })
🛑 Requirement Confirmation: The 'password length >= 8' requirement was *not met*. The action correctly failed with the expected error: 'Password must be at least 8 characters long.'.

🎉 Test Result: PasswordAuthenticationConcept: register() - Fails with password shorter than 8 characters (requires) ... ✅ PASSED! (726ms)

***

**3. PasswordAuthenticationConcept: register() - Fails with username shorter than 8 characters (requires)**

\--- Action Test: register() - Fails with short username ---

➡️ Attempting to register user with a short username 'short'.
🚫 Action: register({ username: "short", password: "..." })
🛑 Requirement Confirmation: The 'username length >= 8' requirement was *not met*. The action correctly failed with the expected error: 'Username must be at least 8 characters long.'.

🎉 Test Result: PasswordAuthenticationConcept: register() - Fails with username shorter than 8 characters (requires) ... ✅ PASSED! (1s)

***

**4. PasswordAuthenticationConcept: authenticate() - Fails with non-existent username (requires)**

\--- Action Test: authenticate() - Fails with non-existent username ---

➡️ Attempting to authenticate non-existent user 'nonExistentUser'.
🚫 Action: authenticate({ username: "nonExistentUser", password: "..." })
🛑 Requirement Confirmation: The 'username exists' requirement was *not met*. The action correctly failed with the expected error: 'Invalid username or password.'.

🎉 Test Result: PasswordAuthenticationConcept: authenticate() - Fails with non-existent username (requires) ... ✅ PASSED! (1s)

***

**5. PasswordAuthenticationConcept: authenticate() - Fails with incorrect password (effects)**

\--- Action Test: authenticate() - Fails with incorrect password ---

✅ Step 1: Registering user 'authFailedUser'.
✨ Effect: User 'authFailedUser' registered.

➡️ Step 2: Attempting to authenticate user 'authFailedUser' with an incorrect password.
🚫 Action: authenticate({ username: "authFailedUser", password: "wrongPassword" })
🛑 Effect Confirmation: The password mismatch correctly led to an error, confirming password verification failure as expected.

🎉 Test Result: PasswordAuthenticationConcept: authenticate() - Fails with incorrect password (effects) ... ✅ PASSED! (1s)

***

**6. PasswordAuthenticationConcept: Multiple distinct users can register and authenticate independently, and be listed**

\--- Interesting Case: Multiple Independent Users (with \_getAllUsers check) ---

✅ Step 1: Registering User A ('userAlice').
✨ Effect: User A registered with ID: 0199ead1-bde2-7f2c-9b70-363d4fd49459.

✅ Step 2: Registering User B ('userBob1').
✨ Effect: User B registered with ID: 0199ead1-be57-760d-9767-9a626da3f8a1.
🎯 Effect Confirmation: Distinct User IDs were generated for different users.

✅ Step 3: Authenticating User A ('userAlice').
✨ Effect: User A authenticated successfully.

✅ Step 4: Authenticating User B ('userBob1').
✨ Effect: User B authenticated successfully.

➡️ Step 5: Querying for all registered users.
✨ Effect Confirmation: `_getAllUsers` correctly listed all registered user IDs: \[0199ead1-bde2-7f2c-9b70-363d4fd49459, 0199ead1-be57-760d-9767-9a626da3f8a1].

🎯 Interesting case fulfilled: This demonstrates that the concept correctly handles multiple independent users, allowing each to register and authenticate without interference, and that all registered users are retrievable by ID through the `_getAllUsers` query, aligning with expected multi-user system behavior and query functionality.

🎉 Test Result: PasswordAuthenticationConcept: Multiple distinct users can register and authenticate independently, and be listed ... ✅ PASSED! (1s)
