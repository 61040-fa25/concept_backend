# response:

Okay, I understand. The constraint is to **avoid direct database queries within the tests** and instead rely solely on the concept's public actions and queries to confirm effects and requirements.

The previous test `PasswordAuthenticationConcept: register() - Successfully adds user with valid credentials (effects)` contained a direct `db.collection("PasswordAuthentication.users").findOne({ _id: userId })` call. Since the concept's public API (actions `register`, `authenticate`, query `_getAllUsers`) does not expose a way to retrieve a user's username by their ID, this specific assertion (checking the username in the database) cannot be performed without violating the "no direct database query" rule.

The updated test will focus on confirming what *can* be verified through the public API: that `register` returns a `UserID` on success.

Here's the revised test file:
