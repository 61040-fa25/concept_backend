# response:

It appears that the TypeScript implementation for the `SongRecommender` concept was not provided.

To generate the API documentation, I need the `SongRecommender` concept's TypeScript class definition, including its `purpose`, `state` interfaces, `actions` (methods) with their signatures, `requires`, and `effects` comments, and any `queries`.

Please provide the TypeScript code for the `SongRecommender` concept, and I will generate the API documentation accordingly.
