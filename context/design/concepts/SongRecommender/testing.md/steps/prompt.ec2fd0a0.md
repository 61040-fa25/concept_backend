# prompt: Given the context files and this concept, implement the addSongtoCatalog action and setup whatever state is necessary to do that. DO NOT ASSUME ANYTHING FROM THE CONCEPT SPEC AND THE IMPLEMENTATION MUST USE TS AND MONGO. Only work with what is given to you. Do not use Mongoose. Try to only use the Allowed Imports and you don't need to setup DB connection, assume that already exists.
