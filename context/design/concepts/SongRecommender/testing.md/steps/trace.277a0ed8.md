# trace:

The following trace demonstrates how the **principle** of the `SongRecommender` concept is fulfilled by a sequence of actions.

1. **Given**: A user `userA`.
2. **Action**: `userA` initially adds several songs to their catalog that they might want to be recommended later.
   ```
   SongRecommender.addSongToCatalog({ user: "userA", song: "song1" })
   SongRecommender.addSongToCatalog({ user: "userA", song: "song2" })
   SongRecommender.addSongToCatalog({ user: "userA", song: "song3" })
   ```
3. **Result**: `song1`, `song2`, `song3` are added to `userA`'s `notYetRecommendedSongs`.
   ```
   {} // for each call
   // Internal state: userA's notYetRecommendedSongs = ["song1", "song2", "song3"], pastRecommendations = []
   ```
4. **Action**: The system, acting daily, generates a recommendation for `userA`.
   ```
   SongRecommender.generateRecommendation({ user: "userA", count: 1 })
   ```
5. **Result**: A song (e.g., `song1`) is returned as a recommendation. This song is moved from `notYetRecommendedSongs` to `pastRecommendations`.
   ```
   { songs: ["song1"] }
   // Internal state: userA's notYetRecommendedSongs = ["song2", "song3"], pastRecommendations = ["song1"]
   ```
6. **Action**: On the next day, the system generates another recommendation for `userA`.
   ```
   SongRecommender.generateRecommendation({ user: "userA", count: 1 })
   ```
7. **Result**: Another song (e.g., `song2`) is returned as a recommendation and moved to `pastRecommendations`.
   ```
   { songs: ["song2"] }
   // Internal state: userA's notYetRecommendedSongs = ["song3"], pastRecommendations = ["song1", "song2"]
   ```
8. **Verification**: The user can "revisit" past recommendations by checking their `pastRecommendations` list.
   ```
   SongRecommender._getUserCatalog("userA")
   ```
9. **Result**: The user's catalog shows `song1` and `song2` in `pastRecommendations`, indicating they have been recommended and can be revisited.
   ```
   {
     _id: "userA",
     notYetRecommendedSongs: ["song3"],
     pastRecommendations: ["song1", "song2"]
   }
   ```
10. **Action**: `userA` decides they don't want `song3` to ever be recommended, so they remove it from their catalog before it's presented.
    ```
    SongRecommender.removeSong({ user: "userA", song: "song3" })
    ```
11. **Result**: `song3` is successfully removed from `userA`'s `notYetRecommendedSongs`.
    ```
    {}
    // Internal state: userA's notYetRecommendedSongs = [], pastRecommendations = ["song1", "song2"]
    ```
