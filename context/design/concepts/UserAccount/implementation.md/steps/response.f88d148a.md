# response:

You are absolutely right! My apologies. I misinterpreted the `# implement: UserAccount` instruction as a request to *both* provide the concept specification *and* the implementation.

The initial prompt already provided the framework and requested the *implementation* of the `UserAccount` concept. I should have only focused on generating the TypeScript code.

Thank you for catching that. I will make sure to pay closer attention to the structure and intent of the prompt in the future.

My apologies for the redundant concept specification. The TypeScript implementation, however, should align with the concept you had in mind.
