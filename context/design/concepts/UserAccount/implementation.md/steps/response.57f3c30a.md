# response:

You're absolutely right to ask "still doesn't work, do we need to use Deno?". This indicates a potential fundamental issue with the Deno environment setup or how you're running the code.

The error message `Inline 'npm:', 'jsr:' or 'https:' dependency not allowed` is Deno telling you that direct `https://` imports for standard library modules or `jsr:` imports need to be resolved via a `deno.json` (or `deno.jsonc`) configuration file.

Here's a comprehensive approach to get it working, covering the Deno setup and the `deno.json` configuration:

## Solution: Verify Deno Runtime and Configuration

### 1. **Confirm You Are Running with Deno**

First and foremost, ensure you are actually executing your TypeScript code using the Deno runtime, not Node.js or any other environment.

To run a Deno script (e.g., `main.ts` or `src/UserAccount/test.ts`), you would use a command like this from your project root:

```bash
deno run --allow-net --allow-env --allow-read --allow-write main.ts
# Or, if running a specific test file:
# deno test src/UserAccount/UserAccountConcept.test.ts
```

The `--allow-*` flags grant necessary permissions (for network access to MongoDB, reading `.env`, etc.).

### 2. **Check Your Deno Version**

`jsr:` imports were introduced in Deno **1.37**. If your Deno version is older, `jsr` imports simply won't work.

Check your Deno version:

```bash
deno --version
```

If it's older than 1.37, update Deno:

```bash
deno upgrade
```

### 3. **Ensure `deno.json` is Correctly Configured**

You need a `deno.json` file in your project's root directory. This file tells Deno how to resolve modules.

**Create/Update `deno.json`**:

Make sure your `deno.json` looks like this. The key for `jsr:` imports in `imports` should typically be a bare specifier (like `"bcrypt"`) that maps to the full `jsr:` URL.

```json
// deno.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["deno.window", "deno.unstable"]
  },
  "imports": {
    "@utils/": "./utils/",
    "@concepts/": "./src/",
    "mongodb": "npm:mongodb@^6.5.0",
    "bcrypt": "jsr:@deno-contrib/bcrypt@^0.3.0"
  }
}
```

**Explanation of `deno.json`:**

* `compilerOptions.lib`: Specifies the default libraries to include for compilation. `deno.window` (for browser APIs) and `deno.unstable` (for unstable Deno APIs) are common.
* `imports`: This is the crucial part for module resolution.
  * `"@utils/"`: Maps the bare specifier `@utils/` to your local `utils/` directory.
  * `"@concepts/"`: Maps `@concepts/` to your local `src/` directory.
  * `"mongodb": "npm:mongodb@^6.5.0"`: Tells Deno to resolve `"mongodb"` imports to the `npm` package `mongodb`.
  * `"bcrypt": "jsr:@deno-contrib/bcrypt@^0.3.0"`: This maps the bare specifier `"bcrypt"` to the specific package and version from the JSR registry.

### 4. **Update `UserAccountConcept.ts` Import Statement**

With the `deno.json` configured as above, your `UserAccountConcept.ts` file's import for bcrypt should now use the bare specifier `"bcrypt"`.
