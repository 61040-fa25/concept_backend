# trace:

This trace demonstrates the operational principle: "a user must register and log in to be identified".

1. **Register a new user**: We begin by calling the `register` action with a new user's details (email, password, display name). This creates the user within the concept's state.
   * **Action**: `UserAccount.register({ email: "alice@example.com", password: "password123", displayName: "Alice" })`
   * **Expected State Change**: A new `User` document is created in the database with the provided email, a hashed version of the password, and the display name.
   * **Expected Result**: The action returns an object containing the unique ID of the newly created user, e.g., `{ user: "user:123abc..." }`.

2. **Log in as the new user**: Using the same credentials, we call the `login` action to verify the user's identity against the stored state.
   * **Action**: `UserAccount.login({ email: "alice@example.com", password: "password123" })`
   * **Expected State Change**: None. This action only reads the state to verify credentials.
   * **Expected Result**: The action returns an object containing the user's ID, which should match the ID returned from the `register` step, confirming the user has been successfully identified, e.g., `{ user: "user:123abc..." }`.

3. **(Optional Verification)** **Query the user's profile**: We can use the `_getUserProfile` query with the user's ID to confirm their data is correctly stored and retrievable.
   * **Query**: `UserAccount._getUserProfile({ user: "user:123abc..." })`
   * **Expected Result**: Returns the user's public data, e.g., `{ displayName: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com" }`.

This sequence successfully demonstrates that a user can be created and then subsequently identified by the system, fulfilling the core purpose and principle of the `UserAccount` concept.
