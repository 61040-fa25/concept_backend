# trace:

The following trace describes the test execution for the **operational principle** of the `UserAccount` concept.

1. **Action**: `register`
   * **Input**: `{ email: "alice@example.com", password: "password123", displayName: "Alice" }`
   * **Description**: A new user, Alice, attempts to create an account. The system checks if her email is already in use. Since it's a fresh database, it is not.
   * **Effect**: A new user record is created in the state. The user's password is securely hashed and stored.
   * **Output**: `{ user: <ID for Alice> }`
   * **Verification**: The test confirms that the output contains a valid user ID and no error message.

2. **Action**: `login`
   * **Input**: `{ email: "alice@example.com", password: "password123" }`
   * **Description**: Alice now attempts to log in with the credentials she just used to register. The system finds the user record by email.
   * **Effect**: The provided plain-text password is hashed and compared against the stored hash. Since they match, the authentication is successful. (A `Session` concept, if present, would now be triggered to create a session).
   * **Output**: `{ user: <ID for Alice> }`
   * **Verification**: The test confirms that the output contains the same user ID that was returned during registration, signifying a successful login for the correct user.
