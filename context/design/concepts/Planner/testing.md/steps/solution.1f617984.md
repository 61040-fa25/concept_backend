# solution:

The `PlannerConcept` implementation is correct. The fix is to correct the failing test case, "Scenario 1," to accurately reflect the intended behavior of `replan`.

The corrected test will set up a more explicit scenario:

1. An initial plan is created in the morning (`9 AM`). This plan includes one task for the morning (`task:morning-work`) and one task scheduled for later in the afternoon (`task:afternoon-work`), separated by a long "busy slot" to force the scheduling.
2. A `replan` is then simulated mid-day (`1 PM`).
3. The assertions will now correctly verify that:
   * The morning task, whose start time is before the replan, is **preserved**.
   * The afternoon task, whose start time is after the replan, is **deleted**.
   * The new tasks from the replan action are successfully scheduled.

This revised test now correctly validates the boundary condition of the `replan` action, ensuring the test suite is both accurate and robust.
