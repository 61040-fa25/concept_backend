# trace:

The trace demonstrates the operational principle: "it intelligently fits a user's prioritized tasks into the open slots in their schedule".

1. **`planDay({ user: "user:alice", tasks: [...], busySlots: [...] })`**
   * **Action**: A user, Alice, starts her day. She has three tasks to complete: `task1` (1hr), `task2` (1.5hr), and `task3` (0.5hr). She also has a meeting scheduled from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM. She uses `planDay` to create a schedule.
   * **State Change**:
     * The concept first calculates the available time slots for the day (e.g., 9:00-11:00 AM and 12:00-5:00 PM), avoiding the `busySlot`.
     * It then iterates through her prioritized task list and fits them into the available slots.
     * `task1` (1hr) is scheduled from 9:00 to 10:00 AM.
     * `task2` (1.5hr) cannot fit in the remaining morning slot, so it is scheduled after the meeting, from 12:00 to 1:30 PM.
     * `task3` (0.5hr) can fit in the morning slot, so it is scheduled from 10:00 to 10:30 AM.
     * The database is updated with three `ScheduledTask` documents for Alice, each with an owner, task ID, and start/end times.
   * **Output**: The action returns `{ firstTask: "task:1" }`, indicating the first item on her schedule for the day.

2. **`getNextTask({ user: "user:alice", completedTask: "task:1" })`**
   * **Action**: Alice completes `task1` at 10:00 AM and wants to know what's next. She calls `getNextTask`, passing in the ID of the completed task.
   * **State Change**: None. This is a query of the current schedule.
   * **Output**: The concept looks at Alice's schedule, finds the task starting at or after the end time of `task1`. This is `task3`, which starts at 10:00 AM. The action returns `{ nextTask: "task:3" }`.

This trace shows the concept successfully creating a realistic plan around constraints and allowing the user to progress through that plan as intended.
