# solution:

The solution is to refine the deletion logic within the `replan` method. Instead of deleting tasks based on their start time, we should delete any task that has not yet finished. This can be achieved by changing the query condition from `plannedStart: { $gte: now }` to `plannedEnd: { $gt: now }`.

This change correctly identifies all tasks that are either in progress or scheduled for the future as "remaining" and ensures they are cleared before the new schedule is generated. This makes the `replan` action more robust and aligns its behavior with the test's expectation.
