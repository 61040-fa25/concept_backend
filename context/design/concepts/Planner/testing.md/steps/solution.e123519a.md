# solution:

The bug is in the `planDay` implementation. It should not schedule tasks in the past. The fix is to make `planDay` schedule tasks starting from the current time (`now`) if the day has already begun, rather than always starting from midnight.

This ensures that all tasks scheduled by `planDay` are in the future. Consequently, when `replan` is called, its logic to delete tasks from `now` onwards will correctly clear the entire old plan, aligning the implementation with the test's (and the user's) expectation.

By fixing the implementation of `PlannerConcept.ts`, the original test file `PlannerConcept.test.ts` will pass without any modifications.
