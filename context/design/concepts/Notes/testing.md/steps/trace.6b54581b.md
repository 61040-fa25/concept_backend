# trace:

The principle for the `Notes` concept is:
"user can store notes or other textual information; the user can also remove notes; the user can also use an llm to turn notes into question/answer pairs (flashcards) based on the notes"

Here's a trace demonstrating how this principle is fulfilled:

1. **Initial State**: The `NotesConcept` instance is initialized, and the database for notes is empty for `USER_ALICE`.

2. **Action: `addNotes` (Store Notes)**
   * **Call**: `notesConcept.addNotes({ user: USER_ALICE, name: "Talmud Basics", content: "The Talmud is a central text..." })`
   * **Requires**: No existing note for `USER_ALICE` with name "Talmud Basics". (This is true, so the action proceeds).
   * **Effects**: A new note document for `USER_ALICE` with name "Talmud Basics" and the provided content is inserted into the `notes` collection.
   * **Assertion**: A subsequent `_getUserNotes({ user: USER_ALICE })` query would show "Talmud Basics" among Alice's notes.

3. **Action: `notesToFlashCards` (Generate Flashcards)**
   * **Setup**: The `GeminiLLM.prototype.executeLLM` method is temporarily mocked to return a predefined valid JSON string representing flashcards.
   * **Call**: `notesConcept.notesToFlashCards({ user: USER_ALICE, name: "Talmud Basics" })`
   * **Requires**: A note exists for `USER_ALICE` with name "Talmud Basics". (This is true from step 2, so the LLM interaction is simulated).
   * **Effects**:
     * The concept retrieves the content of "Talmud Basics" note.
     * It constructs an LLM prompt using this content.
     * It calls the (mocked) `GeminiLLM.executeLLM` which returns the predefined flashcard JSON.
     * The concept parses this JSON into `Flashcard` objects.
     * It returns an object `{ cards: [...] }` containing these flashcards.
   * **Assertion**: The returned object contains an array of `Flashcard` objects derived from the mocked LLM response, verifying the parsing and return of the concept.

4. **Action: `removeNotes` (Remove Notes)**
   * **Call**: `notesConcept.removeNotes({ user: USER_ALICE, name: "Talmud Basics" })`
   * **Requires**: A note exists for `USER_ALICE` with name "Talmud Basics". (This is true from step 2, so the action proceeds).
   * **Effects**: The note document for `USER_ALICE` with name "Talmud Basics" is deleted from the `notes` collection.
   * **Assertion**: A subsequent `_getUserNotes({ user: USER_ALICE })` query would *not* show "Talmud Basics" among Alice's notes, confirming its removal.

This sequence of actions (`addNotes`, `notesToFlashCards`, `removeNotes`) directly demonstrates all aspects of the concept's stated principle.
