# response:

This test file, `src/concepts/Profile/ProfileConcept.test.ts`, systematically verifies the functionality of the `ProfileConcept` as defined in its specification. It uses Deno's built-in testing framework and an isolated MongoDB database instance for each test run.

Here's an explanation of each test step:

### Global Test Setup and Teardown

* **`Deno.test.beforeAll`**: This hook runs once before all tests (and test steps) in this file begin.
  * It initializes a shared MongoDB database instance (`dbInstance`) and client (`clientInstance`) using `testDb()`. This ensures that all tests in this file operate against a consistent and isolated database.
  * `console.log` messages indicate the start of the test suite's database initialization.
* **`Deno.test.afterAll`**: This hook runs once after all tests (and test steps) in this file have completed.
  * It safely closes the MongoDB client (`clientInstance`), releasing database resources.
  * `console.log` messages confirm the client closure.
* **`Deno.test("Profile Concept Tests Suite", ...)`**: This defines the main test suite that encapsulates all individual test steps.
  * `sanitizeResources: false` and `sanitizeOps: false` are set. These flags can prevent Deno from reporting unclosed resources or uncaught promise rejections in complex async scenarios like database interactions, making tests more stable if resource management is handled explicitly (as it is here with `beforeAll`/`afterAll`).
  * **Crucial Pattern for Isolation**: Inside *each* `test.step`, the following lines are executed:
    ```typescript
    const profileConcept = new ProfileConcept(dbInstance);
    await profileConcept.clearCollections();
    console.log("  Clearing ProfileConcept collections before test step...");
    ```
    This is paramount for test isolation. It ensures that every individual `test.step` starts with an empty state for the `ProfileConcept`'s collections (users), preventing data from previous steps from interfering with the current one. This is key to robust unit testing for concepts.

### Individual Test Steps

1. **"Action: createAccount - Successful creation"**
   * **Purpose**: To verify that the `createAccount` action successfully creates a new user when all `requires` conditions are met.
   * **Actions**: Calls `createAccount` with a unique username ("alice") and a password that meets security criteria (length > 8).
   * **Assertions**:
     * `assertExists((result as { user: ID }).user)`: Checks that a user ID is returned upon successful creation, fulfilling the `effects` clause.
     * `profileConcept._getAllUsers()` and `assertEquals(users.length, 1)`: Verifies that exactly one user was added to the database.
     * `assertEquals(users[0].username, username)`: Confirms the username of the created user matches the input.
     * `profileConcept._getUserDetails()` and `assertEquals((userDetails as Array<{ username: string }>)[0].username, username)`: Ensures the user's details (specifically the username) can be retrieved correctly using the new user ID.
   * **Verifies `requires`**: Username is not existing, password is secure.
   * **Verifies `effects`**: Creates a new user with username and hashed password, returns user ID.

2. **"Action: createAccount - Duplicate username"**
   * **Purpose**: To verify that `createAccount` correctly handles the scenario where a username already exists, as specified by its `requires` clause.
   * **Actions**: Creates an account for "bob", then attempts to create another account with the *same* username.
   * **Assertions**:
     * `assertExists((result as { error: string }).error)`: Checks that an error is returned.
     * `assertEquals((result as { error: string }).error, \`Username '${username}' already exists.\`)`: Verifies the specific error message, confirming the `requires` condition (`username is not an existing username\`) was enforced.

3. **"Action: createAccount - Insecure password"**
   * **Purpose**: To verify that `createAccount` rejects passwords that do not meet the security criteria, as specified by its `requires` clause.
   * **Actions**: Attempts to create an account for "charlie" with a short, insecure password ("short").
   * **Assertions**:
     * `assertExists((result as { error: string }).error)`: Checks that an error is returned.
     * `assertEquals((result as { error: string }).error, "Password must be at least 8 characters long.")`: Verifies the specific error message, confirming the `requires` condition (`password is sufficiently secure`) was enforced.

4. **"Action: authenticate - Successful authentication"**
   * **Purpose**: To verify that the `authenticate` action correctly authenticates a user with valid credentials.
   * **Actions**: Creates an account for "david", then attempts to authenticate using "david" and the correct password.
   * **Assertions**:
     * `assertExists((result as { user: ID }).user)`: Checks that a user ID is returned.
     * `assertEquals((result as { user: ID }).user, userId)`: Confirms the returned user ID matches the ID of the created user, fulfilling the `effects` clause.
   * **Verifies `requires`**: Username and hashed password correspond to an existing user.
   * **Verifies `effects`**: Returns the associated user.

5. **"Action: authenticate - Invalid username"**
   * **Purpose**: To verify that `authenticate` fails when the provided username does not exist.
   * **Actions**: Attempts to authenticate with a username ("nonExistent") that was never created.
   * **Assertions**: Checks for an error and verifies the specific error message "Invalid username or password.", confirming the `requires` condition was enforced.

6. **"Action: authenticate - Incorrect password"**
   * **Purpose**: To verify that `authenticate` fails when the provided password does not match the stored password hash for the given username.
   * **Actions**: Creates an account for "eve", then attempts to authenticate with "eve" but an incorrect password ("wrongPassword").
   * **Assertions**: Checks for an error and verifies the specific error message "Invalid username or password.", confirming the `requires` condition was enforced.

7. **"Action: changePassword - Successful password change"**
   * **Purpose**: To verify that `changePassword` successfully updates a user's password, invalidates the old password, and makes the new password effective.
   * **Actions**:
     1. Creates an account for "frank".
     2. Authenticates with the `oldPassword` (expected success).
     3. Calls `changePassword` with the correct `userId`, `oldPassword`, and a `newPassword`.
     4. Attempts to authenticate with the `oldPassword` again (expected failure).
     5. Attempts to authenticate with the `newPassword` (expected success).
   * **Assertions**: A series of `assertExists` and `assertEquals` calls to confirm successful authentication with the old password initially, then the `changePassword` return, and finally, authentication failure with the old password and success with the new one.
   * **Verifies `requires`**: User exists, old password matches, new password is secure.
   * **Verifies `effects`**: User's `passwordHash` is modified, returns user ID.

8. **"Action: changePassword - Incorrect old password"**
   * **Purpose**: To verify that `changePassword` fails if the provided `oldPassword` does not match the current password hash.
   * **Actions**: Creates an account for "grace", then attempts to change its password using an incorrect `oldPassword`.
   * **Assertions**: Checks for an error and verifies the specific error message "Incorrect old password.", confirming the `requires` condition was enforced.

9. **"Action: changePassword - Insecure new password"**
   * **Purpose**: To verify that `changePassword` fails if the `newPassword` provided does not meet security criteria.
   * **Actions**: Creates an account for "heidi", then attempts to change its password to an insecure `newPassword` ("short").
   * **Assertions**: Checks for an error and verifies the specific error message "New password must be at least 8 characters long.", confirming the `requires` condition was enforced.

10. **"Action: changePassword - New password same as old"**
    * **Purpose**: To verify that `changePassword` prevents a user from changing their password to the exact same password they currently use.
    * **Actions**: Creates an account for "ivan", then attempts to change its password to the *same* password.
    * **Assertions**: Checks for an error and verifies the specific error message "New password cannot be the same as the old password.", demonstrating good practice beyond the minimal "sufficiently secure" requirement.

11. **"Action: changePassword - User not found"**
    * **Purpose**: To verify that `changePassword` fails if the target user identified by `userId` does not exist.
    * **Actions**: Attempts to change the password for a `nonExistentUser`.
    * **Assertions**: Checks for an error and verifies the specific error message `User '${nonExistentUser}' not found.`, confirming the `requires` condition (`user exists`) was enforced.

12. **"Action: deleteAccount - Successful deletion"**
    * **Purpose**: To verify that `deleteAccount` successfully removes a user from the system, making them unable to authenticate.
    * **Actions**:
      1. Creates an account for "john".
      2. Verifies one user exists using `_getAllUsers`.
      3. Calls `deleteAccount` for "john".
      4. Verifies no users exist using `_getAllUsers`.
      5. Attempts to authenticate "john" (expected failure).
    * **Assertions**: Confirms the user count changes from 1 to 0, verifies the empty object return for success, and asserts that authentication for the deleted user fails.
    * **Verifies `requires`**: User exists (initially).
    * **Verifies `effects`**: Removes user from the set of Users.

13. **"Action: deleteAccount - User not found"**
    * **Purpose**: To verify that `deleteAccount` gracefully handles attempts to delete a user that does not exist.
    * **Actions**: Attempts to delete a `nonExistentUser`.
    * **Assertions**: Checks for an error and verifies the specific error message `User '${nonExistentUser}' not found.`, confirming the `requires` condition (`user exists`) was enforced.

14. **"Query: \_getUserDetails - Retrieve user details"**
    * **Purpose**: To verify that the `_getUserDetails` query returns the username of an existing user and *does not* expose sensitive information like the password hash.
    * **Actions**: Creates an account for "karen", then calls `_getUserDetails` for that user.
    * **Assertions**:
      * `assertExists(userDetails)` and `assertEquals(userDetails[0].username, username)`: Confirms the username is correctly retrieved.
      * `assertEquals(Object.keys((userDetails as Array<{ username: string }>)[0]).includes("passwordHash"), false)`: **Crucially**, asserts that the `passwordHash` field is NOT present in the returned user details, adhering to security best practices.
    * **Verifies `requires`**: User exists.
    * **Verifies `effects`**: Returns username (and potentially other non-sensitive profile info).

15. **"Query: \_getUserDetails - User not found"**
    * **Purpose**: To verify that `_getUserDetails` returns an error when queried for a user that does not exist.
    * **Actions**: Calls `_getUserDetails` for a `nonExistentUser`.
    * **Assertions**: Checks for an error and verifies the specific error message `User '${nonExistentUser}' not found.`, confirming the `requires` condition was enforced.

16. **"Query: \_getAllUsers - Retrieve all users"**
    * **Purpose**: To verify that the `_getAllUsers` query correctly returns a list of all existing users, including their IDs and usernames.
    * **Actions**: Creates two accounts ("user1", "user2"), then calls `_getAllUsers`.
    * **Assertions**:
      * `assertEquals(users.length, 2)`: Confirms that two users are returned.
      * `assertEquals(usernames, ["user1", "user2"])`: Verifies that the correct usernames are present in the returned list.
    * **Verifies `requires`**: True (always allowed).
    * **Verifies `effects`**: Returns an array of user IDs and usernames.

17. **"Principle: A user can create an account and sign in with a username/password. Users can also change their password."**
    * **Purpose**: This is the principle test, which acts as a narrative integration test. It steps through the core scenario outlined in the concept's `principle` statement to ensure the concept fulfills its main purpose end-to-end.
    * **Actions (Trace)**:
      1. `createAccount`: Creates a user "principleUser" with an `initialPassword`.
      2. `authenticate`: Authenticates the user with the `initialPassword` (expected success).
      3. `changePassword`: Changes the user's password from `initialPassword` to `newPassword`.
      4. `authenticate`: Attempts to authenticate with the `initialPassword` (expected failure).
      5. `authenticate`: Attempts to authenticate with the `newPassword` (expected success).
    * **Assertions**: At each step, it asserts the expected outcome (successful user creation, authentication, password change, and then the correct invalidation of the old password and validation of the new one).
    * **Verifies Principle**: This comprehensive sequence of actions and assertions directly demonstrates that "A user can create an account and sign in with a username/password. Users can also change their password." is fully supported by the `ProfileConcept`.
