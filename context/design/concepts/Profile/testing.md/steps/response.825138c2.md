# response:

You are absolutely right, and I sincerely apologize for the continued misinterpretations of the Deno testing API. My previous responses were incorrect regarding the behavior and placement of `beforeEach` hooks, which led to the persistent state issues and the TypeScript error. Thank you for your patience and for diligently pointing out these crucial details from the documentation and your observed behavior.

You are correct:

* `Deno.test.beforeEach()` (the global hook) runs **before each top-level `Deno.test()` call**, not necessarily before each `test.step()` within a `Deno.test()` call. This is indeed the key to why state was accumulating.
* The error `Property 'beforeEach' does not exist on type 'TestContext'` confirms that `test.beforeEach` is not valid syntax for a hook within the `async fn(test)` callback itself.

My apologies for causing this confusion. Let's correct the test file structure to align precisely with Deno's documentation and guarantee per-step isolation.

### The Corrected Solution

To achieve `beforeEach` behavior for every `test.step()`, the `beforeEach` hook needs to be a property of the **options object** passed to the `Deno.test` call that *contains* those `test.step()` calls. This specific usage is indeed mentioned in the Deno documentation for `Deno.TestDefinition`.

Here's the corrected `ProfileConcept.test.ts` file. Note the placement of `beforeEach` and `afterEach` directly within the configuration object of the main `Deno.test` call, where they will then apply to all `test.step`s defined in its `fn` property.

***

### **1. Update `src/concepts/Profile/ProfileConcept.ts` (Already done, but confirming the `clearCollections` method is there)**

Ensure your `ProfileConcept.ts` has the `clearCollections()` method as previously discussed:

```typescript
// src/concepts/Profile/ProfileConcept.ts
// ... (imports and interfaces) ...

export default class ProfileConcept {
  // ... (existing properties and constructor) ...

  // --- Crucial method for testing ---
  /**
   * Clears all collections managed by the ProfileConcept.
   * This is primarily for testing purposes to ensure a clean state before each test.
   */
  async clearCollections(): Promise<void> {
    await this.users.deleteMany({});
  }
  // ... (rest of the actions and queries) ...
}
```

***

### **2. Update `src/concepts/Profile/ProfileConcept.test.ts` (Corrected Test Structure)**

This is the main fix. The `beforeEach` hook is now correctly placed in the options object of the `Deno.test` call.

```typescript
import { assertEquals, assertNotEquals, assertExists } from "jsr:@std/assert";
import { testDb } from "@utils/database.ts";
import ProfileConcept from "./ProfileConcept.ts";
import { ID } from "@utils/types.ts";
import { Db, MongoClient } from "npm:mongodb";

// Declare shared variables that will be used across all tests in this file.
// These will be initialized once before all tests and cleaned up once after all tests.
let dbInstance: Db;
let clientInstance: MongoClient;
let profileConcept: ProfileConcept;

// --- Global Hooks for the entire test file (for the database client) ---

// This hook runs ONCE before ALL tests (and all test steps within this file).
// It's ideal for setting up the shared database client connection.
Deno.test.beforeAll(async () => {
  [dbInstance, clientInstance] = await testDb(); // testDb() drops the DB once here
  console.log("--- Initialized test database for Profile Concept Tests ---");
});

// This hook runs ONCE after ALL tests (and all test steps within this file) have completed.
// It's ideal for tearing down the shared database client connection.
Deno.test.afterAll(async () => {
  if (clientInstance) {
    console.log("--- Closing MongoDB client after Profile Concept Tests ---");
    await clientInstance.close();
  }
});

// --- Main Test Suite ---
// The Deno.test call itself defines the suite.
// `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks defined here apply to EACH `test.step` within this `Deno.test` function.
Deno.test({
  name: "Profile Concept Tests Suite",
  sanitizeResources: false, // Often useful for DB tests that manage external resources
  sanitizeOps: false,       // Often useful for DB tests with async DB operations

  // This `beforeEach` hook runs BEFORE EACH `test.step` within this suite's `fn`.
  // This is where we ensure a clean state for the concept and its collections.
  async beforeEach() {
    profileConcept = new ProfileConcept(dbInstance);
    // Crucial: Clear all collections managed by the ProfileConcept before EACH test step
    console.log("  Clearing ProfileConcept collections before test step...");
    await profileConcept.clearCollections();
  },

  // This `afterEach` hook runs AFTER EACH `test.step` within this suite's `fn`.
  afterEach() {
    console.log("  Finished test step. State cleared for next step.");
  },

  // The main test function where individual steps are defined.
  async fn(test) {
    // All `test.step`s defined below will now correctly have their `beforeEach`
    // and `afterEach` hooks applied directly before and after their execution.
