# response:

No, the implementation does **not** need to change.

My previous response correctly identified the problematic line in the concept's `createUserSettings` effect: "if locale is a Document, set document's current to settings." I noted that this line violates Concept Independence and proposed that it should be removed from the `TextSettings` concept itself and handled by an external `sync`.

Crucially, I also stated: "The implementation of `createUserSettings` in `src/TextSettings/TextSettingsConcept.ts` has already followed this revised interpretation, omitting the problematic clause."

Therefore, if the "fix" in the concept specification was to remove that problematic line, then the current TypeScript implementation already accurately reflects the corrected concept design. It already avoids the cross-concept dependency, which is the desired outcome for Concept Independence.
