## Concept: PoseBreakdown

**Purpose**: extract poses from videos and represent them as collections of parts and points, which can later be compared\
**Principle**: after a video is processed, poses for each frame are stored as structured data

**State**\
A set of **PoseData** with:

* a poseID String
* a partData of Set of PartData

A set of **PartData** with:

* a part Enum (Arm, Leg, etc.)
* a pointData Set of PointData

A set of **PointData** with:

* a orderID Number
* a location Number

**Actions**

* `extractPoses(videoID: String): (poseIDs: Set of String)`
  * Requires: video exists
  * Effect: processes each frame of the video, creates PoseData for each, and stores/returns their IDs

* `getPoseData(poseID: String): (PoseData)`
  * Requires: pose exists
  * Effect: returns stored PoseData for inspection
