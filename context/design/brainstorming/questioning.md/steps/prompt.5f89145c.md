# prompt:

I've provided an example of translating from a concept to a concept testing file.  Please implement the testing file for the folder concept. Make sure you look at the example that I give you, and try to replicate how it chooses test cases.  Do not create a mock db. Really understand the testing example.  If you choose to access private methods by creating an extended class, only use the extended class for testing that specific private method.  Use the actual folder class to test all other methods.  Do not use an in-memory database, and you don't need to clear out everything before each test, please keep it continuous or simply create a new FolderConcept maybe.
