# response:

Of course. This is an excellent refinement. You've pivoted the concept from a general-purpose schedule to a more specific "availability layer," which is a very common and useful pattern.

You've immediately spotted the central challenge in your new definition: the `blockTime` action conflicts with the `principle` of the schedule being a pure "read-only reflection." If a user can manually block time, that's no longer a reflectionâ€”it's a hybrid model.

You're right on the money: if we allow `blockTime`, we absolutely need actions like `updateSlot` and `deleteSlot` to manage those manual entries. And critically, we need to make the `syncCalendar` action "smarter" so it doesn't wipe out the user's manual blocks.

This brings us back to a similar solution as before: we need to distinguish the *origin* of a `BusySlot`.

Here is a revised concept that incorporates your new direction and resolves the conflict.

concept Schedule \[User]
purpose to represent a user's availability by combining non-negotiable, externally-scheduled commitments with manual time blocks
principle The schedule is primarily a read-only reflection of a user's external calendar, but allows for manual additions which are preserved during syncs.

a set of BusySlots with
an owner User
a startTime DateTime
a endTime DateTime
an origin: (EXTERNAL, MANUAL) # Distinguishes calendar events from user-created blocks
