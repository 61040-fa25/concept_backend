# response:

I understand you're asking me to read the content of the markdown files linked in your prompt:

* `../../design/background/implementing-concepts.md`
* `../../design/specificConceptSpecs/passwordAuth.md`

However, as an AI, I cannot directly access local files on your computer or local network paths (like `../../design/background/implementing-concepts.md`). The links you've provided point to files on your local file system, not a web accessible URL.

To help you, please copy and paste the *content* of both `implementing-concepts.md` and `passwordAuth.md` directly into our chat. Once you provide the text, I will be able to read out what your `passwordAuth.md` concept says, as well as understand the context from the `implementing-concepts.md` file.
