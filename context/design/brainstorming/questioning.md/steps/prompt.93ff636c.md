# prompt:

This is how you implement a concept:
[@implementing-concepts.md](../../design/background/implementing-concepts.md)

Please implement the following concept in typescript using the background information above.  Please make it standalone:
[@passwordAuth.md](../../design/specificConceptSpecs/passwordAuth.md)

This is what you have so far implemented.  However, the imports don't make sense because it is importing files that don't exist.\
[@passwordAuth.ts](../../src/concepts/Scriblink/passwordAuth.ts)
