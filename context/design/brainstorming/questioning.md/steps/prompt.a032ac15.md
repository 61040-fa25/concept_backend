[@implementing-concepts.md](../../design/background/implementing-concepts.md)

[@concept.md](../../design/specificConceptSpecs/folder.md)

[@concept](../../context/design/concepts/LikertSurvey/implementation.md/steps/concept.7f5806fa.md)
[@likertSurveyConcept.md](../../design/background/example-concept.md)
