# prompt:

This is how you implement a concept.  Read and understand this throughly because you will do it yourself:
[@implementing-concepts.md](../../design/background/implementing-concepts.md)

Please implement the following concept in typescript using the background information above. Implement it exactly as written in concept.md.
[@concept.md](../../design/specificConceptSpecs/folder.md)

Here's an example of a different concept that was turned into code.  After you're done translating my concept into code, please just tell me about the below concepts so I know you can read it.
[@concept.7f5806fa.md](../../context/design/concepts/LikertSurvey/implementation.md/steps/concept.7f5806fa.md)
[@example-concept.md](../../design/background/example-concept.md)
