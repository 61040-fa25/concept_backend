# Setup

## 0. Fork this repository

First, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) this repository, and **rename** it to your desired project name, and give a description of your project.

## 1. Install Deno

[Install from Deno's website](https://deno.com)

Deno is a secure runtime for JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly. It greatly simplifies tooling and offers a modern development experience.

**Note:** when importing from `npm` packages, prefix with `npm:` as in:

```typescript
import { MongoClient } from "npm:mongo"
```

For VSCode users, consider also installing the Deno [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno) for enhanced IDE support.

## 2. Compile Context

Context is a simple CLI tool that can be used to collaborate with LLMs and drive design. To create a convenient binary, run the following command from the root of the directory:

```shell
deno compile -A --output ctx .ctx/context.ts
```

## 3. Setup Gemini

Copy or change `.env.template` to the environment file: `.env` and insert your Gemini API key:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
```

You can choose any [models](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models) using `GEMINI_MODEL`, such as `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` for faster responses, or `gemini-2.5-pro` for higher quality.

## 4. Setup your MongoDB Atlas Cluster (free)

For this project, we'll be using MongoDB as the database.

### Instructions

1. Create your [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) account.
2. When selecting a template, choose the **free** option, M0.
3. At the Security Quickstart page, select how you want to authenticate your connection and allow access to all IPs as shown in [this slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DBOWIQ2AAGQPDRgmnad8wN9S9M955LcHYZQlnbu-QCs/edit?usp=sharing).
4. Once created, click the **CONNECT** button, select **driver**, and copy the srv connection string. If using username and password, the URL should look something like this: `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.p82ijqd.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority`. Make sure to replace username and password with your actual values.
5. Add your connection URL (without `<` and `>`) to `MONGODB_URL=<connection url>` to your `.env` file.
6. Give your database a name under `DB_NAME=<your database name>`.
