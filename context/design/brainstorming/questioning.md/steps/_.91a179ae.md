# Commenting

Every action should have a comment including its signature, its requirements, and effects:

```typescript
  /**
   * createLabel (name: String): (label: Label)
   *
   * **requires** no Label with the given `name` already exists
   *
   * **effects** creates a new Label `l`; sets the name of `l` to `name`; returns `l` as `label`
   */
```

I have a specification describing how a new concept should work in my app. Please help me create a state representation and actions implementation for it, following the same structure, conventions, and naming style as my existing implemented concept.

Here’s what I want you to do:

Carefully read the provided specification for the new concept.

Look at the provided example of an already implemented concept — this shows how state and actions are structured, named, and documented.

Based on that example, create:

A State interface (TypeScript-style, with appropriate fields and data types).

A set of actions (async or sync functions) that modify or query that state, using the same coding patterns as in the example.

Make sure function names, comments, and behavior align stylistically with the example concept.

Include any mock or placeholder logic where the spec mentions features not yet implemented.

Inputs:

Specification:
\[PASTE your spec here]

Example implemented concept:
\[PASTE your example concept code here]

Output:

newConceptState.ts — defining the TypeScript interface for the state.

newConceptActions.ts — implementing the actions for that state.

Make the code consistent with the example’s structure and include concise JSDoc-style comments for each function.
