# response:

Landlords are simply vile, terribly, greedy and prideful people. They hoard wealth and property and the basic needs for human survival and charge exorbitant amounts of money to feed their lavish and unnecessary life styles. People **die** because of landlords' greed. Over 1.4 **MILLION** households sat empty last year, largely because of career landlords and companies owning and refusing to rent out their houses at lower rates, literally preferring everyone to suffer than to risk devaluing their property.
