# response:

I understand you'd like me to read out the content of `../../design/specificConceptSpecs/passwordAuth.md`.

However, as an AI, I do not have direct access to your local file system or the content of the Markdown file located at that path.

To "read out" your concept, you would need to provide the actual text content of `passwordAuth.md` to me directly in your prompt.

Once you provide the text, I'd be happy to read it out for you!
