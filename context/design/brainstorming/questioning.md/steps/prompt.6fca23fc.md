# prompt: can you summarize all the changes and the reasoning behind them for the Schedule concept:

from this:

concept Schedule \[User]
purpose to represent a user's non-negotiable, externally-scheduled commitments
principle the schedule is a read-only reflection of a user's external calendar
state
a set of BusySlots with
an owner User
a startTime DateTime
a endTime DateTime
actions
syncCalendar (user: User, externalEvents: set of Events)
effect replaces the user's busy slots with a new set based on their external calendar
deleteAllForUser (user: User)
effect removes all busy slots for the user
blockTime (user: User, startTime: DateTime, endTime: DateTime)
effect creates a new BusySlot for the user to represent non-working hours or a manual block
getSlots (user: User): (slots: set of BusySlots)
effect returns all busy slots for the user

to the newer version
