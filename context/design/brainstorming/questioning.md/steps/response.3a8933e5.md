# response:

The `passwordAuth` concept defines the following actions:

### 1. `createPassword(userId, password)`

* **Description**: Sets an initial password for a user. This is typically used during user registration or by an admin to set a temporary password.
* **Preconditions**: User must exist, must not already have a password set (unless admin override), password must meet complexity requirements.
* **Postconditions**: `hashedPassword` and `salt` are set, `lastPasswordChange` is updated.
* **Return**: Success/Failure.

### 2. `loginWithPassword(userId, password)`

* **Description**: Verifies a user's password to grant access.
* **Preconditions**: User must exist, account must not be locked out.
* **Postconditions**: If successful, `failedLoginAttempts` is reset. If failed, `failedLoginAttempts` is incremented, and `isLockedOut` might be set if a threshold is exceeded.
* **Return**: Authentication token or error.

### 3. `changePassword(userId, oldPassword, newPassword)`

* **Description**: Allows a user to change their existing password.
* **Preconditions**: User must exist, `oldPassword` must match, `newPassword` must meet complexity requirements and not be the same as `oldPassword`.
* **Postconditions**: `hashedPassword` is updated, `salt` might be regenerated, `lastPasswordChange` is updated, `failedLoginAttempts` is reset.
* **Return**: Success/Failure.

### 4. `resetPassword(userId, newPassword, adminOverride)`

* **Description**: Resets a user's password, typically by an administrator or via a "forgot password" flow (after verification).
* **Preconditions**: User must exist, `newPassword` must meet complexity requirements, sufficient authorization (admin override or valid reset token).
* **Postconditions**: `hashedPassword` is updated, `salt` might be regenerated, `lastPasswordChange` is updated, `failedLoginAttempts` is reset, `isLockedOut` is set to false.
* **Return**: Success/Failure.
