# Actions for External Syncing and Data Management

syncCalendar (user: User, externalEvents: set of Events)
effect updates the user's schedule to match their external calendar without affecting manual blocks.

* First, removes all of the user's BusySlots where origin is EXTERNAL.
* Then, for each event in externalEvents, creates a new BusySlot with origin set to EXTERNAL, **populating the description from the external event's title.**

deleteAllForUser (user: User)
effect removes all busy slots (both MANUAL and EXTERNAL) for the user. # A full reset

getSlots (user: User): (slots: set of BusySlots)
effect returns all busy slots for the user, regardless of origin
\`

### Summary of Changes:

1. **State:** The `BusySlot` definition now includes a `description` field. I've renamed it from "title" to "description" as it's a more general term that works for both formal events and informal blocks.
2. **`blockTime`:** The action now requires a `description` when a user creates a manual block.
3. **`updateSlot`:** This action now allows the user to change the `description` of a manual block.
4. **`syncCalendar`:** The `effect` explicitly mentions that the `description` is populated from the external event's data (e.g., its title or summary), which formalizes how that data flows into your system.
