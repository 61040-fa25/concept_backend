# response:

Yes, I can definitely help you with advice about tool workflows, and you're right to test!

To clarify your understanding: I don't "import context" in the way a software tool might load a file. Each prompt you give me is processed using my entire training knowledge base. The previous conversation (about landlords) does not restrict my ability to answer new, unrelated questions in subsequent prompts. I process each new request based on its own content, drawing from all the information I was trained on.

Regarding the "ctx tool workflow," "ctx" often refers to "context" in various programming environments, command-line tools, or frameworks. To give you the most accurate and helpful advice, could you please specify which "ctx" tool or system you're referring to? For example, are you thinking of:

* **A specific programming framework:** (e.g., React Context API, a web framework's request context like in Flask or Gin, a specific library's context object)?
* **A command-line tool:** (e.g., Kubernetes `kubectl config use-context`)?
* **A general concept of context management** in a broader software engineering sense?

Once you provide a bit more detail, I'd be happy to share advice on best practices, common workflows, or how to effectively use that specific `ctx` functionality!
