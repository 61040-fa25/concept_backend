# prompt You are implementing automated tests for a **Deno TypeScript backend project**.  The project manages course scheduling using MongoDB. Please evaluate the tests in courseSchedulingConcept.test.ts that are testing the actions in courseScheduling\_actions.ts. Evaluate it based on the instructions given in testing-concepts.md and re-impliment it based on the instructions outlined in testing-concepts.md. Import the actions from courseSchedulingConcept.ts keeping in mind they are all stored in a class called CourseScheduling\_actions.
