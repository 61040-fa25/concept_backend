Alright, let's give "ctx" one last shot with a chuckle. Here's a funny story for you:

My friend, Dave, isn't exactly a culinary genius. His signature dish is "toast." Not, like, *fancy* toast, just... toast. But he decided one year he was going to host Thanksgiving. A brave, if foolish, venture.

He spent days watching YouTube tutorials, buying gadgets, and generally panicking. The big day arrived, and everything was, predictably, a bit of a disaster. The turkey was dry, the gravy was lumpy, and the sweet potato casserole tasted suspiciously like burnt sugar and regret.

However, the real masterpiece was his attempt at "fancy" mashed potatoes. He'd decided they needed to be extra smooth and fluffy. So, he boiled the potatoes, drained them, and then, with an almost scientific determination, reached for his secret weapon: his electric hand mixer.

Now, anyone who's ever made mashed potatoes knows you don't use an electric mixer on them for too long, or they turn into a gluey, starchy paste. Dave, however, had missed that memo. He whirred and beat those poor potatoes like they owed him money.

When he finally brought them to the table, they looked... *wrong*. Not fluffy. Not even lumpy. They had the consistency and sheen of freshly poured cement. A brave aunt took the first spoonful. She tried to lift it to her mouth, but it clung to the spoon like a desperate limpet, stretching out in a thick, elastic string.

She finally managed to get it in her mouth, chewed once, and then, with a look of pure bewilderment, said, "Dave, these are... very *substantial*."

Another cousin tried to scoop some, but it just jiggled on the spoon like a single, giant, gray jelly. We all ended up just scraping a tiny bit onto our plates, mostly to be polite, and then subtly pushing it around.

To this day, we refer to it as "Dave's Concrete Mashed Potatoes." He hasn't hosted Thanksgiving since. But every year, without fail, someone asks, "Hey Dave, are you bringing the *substantial* potatoes this year?" And he just groans.
