# Running Mirror Motion Concept Tests

To ensure the Mirror Motion concepts are functioning correctly, you can run the provided tests using the Deno testing framework.

Tests are defined by any file with the name `filename.test.ts` in your directory. To run all tests for the Mirror Motion concepts (and any other `.test.ts` files), simply run:

```shell
deno test -A
```

The `-A` flag means to give all permissions. This is convenient for development but be mindful of Deno's security model for production environments.

**Confirming your setup:** After running the tests, check your MongoDB Atlas console. You should see temporary collections created within the test database (`test-mirror-motion`). These are automatically wiped every time you start a new test run, ensuring a clean state for each test.
