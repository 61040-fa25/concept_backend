# response:

That's a fantastic suggestion. Thinking about the level of detail needed in your data model is key.

Adding a description is an excellent idea because it provides critical **context**. A busy slot is much more useful when you know *why* it's busy.

Here's a breakdown of why this is a strong addition and how it would look.

### The Case for Adding a Description

1. **User Experience:** For the user managing their own manual blocks, "Lunch" is more informative than just a blocked-out hour. It helps them remember and plan.
2. **Context from External Sources:** For synced events, the event's title (e.g., "Quarterly Review," "Dentist Appointment") is the most important piece of information. Simply blocking the time without that title loses almost all the value of the sync.
3. **Future-Proofing:** It allows for more advanced features later. For example, you could analyze the descriptions to automatically categorize a user's time.
4. **Debugging:** When you look at the raw data, having a description makes it immediately obvious what each `BusySlot` represents, which is invaluable for development and support.

The only potential "con" is privacy, but that's handled at the application layer. The rule should be: "The system stores the description for the user's own reference, but only exposes 'busy'/'free' status to others."

So, yes, you should absolutely add a description. Let's integrate it into the concept.

Here is the revised concept that includes the `description` field and updates the relevant actions.

\`
concept Schedule \[User]
purpose to represent a user's availability by combining non-negotiable, externally-scheduled commitments with manual time blocks
principle The schedule is primarily a read-only reflection of a user's external calendar, but allows for manual additions which are preserved during syncs.

state
a set of BusySlots with
an owner User
a startTime DateTime
a endTime DateTime
**a description String # The title of the event or reason for the block**
an origin: (EXTERNAL, MANUAL) # Distinguishes calendar events from user-created blocks
