# trace:

The following trace demonstrates how the **principle** of the `LikertSurvey` concept is fulfilled by a sequence of actions.

1. **Given**: An author `authorA` and a respondent `respondentB`.
2. **Action**: The author creates a new survey.
   ```
   LikertSurvey.createSurvey({ author: "authorA", title: "Customer Satisfaction", scaleMin: 1, scaleMax: 5 })
   ```
3. **Result**: A new survey is created, and its ID is returned.
   ```
   { survey: "survey1" }
   ```
4. **Action**: The author adds two questions to the survey.
   ```
   LikertSurvey.addQuestion({ survey: "survey1", text: "How satisfied are you...?" })
   LikertSurvey.addQuestion({ survey: "survey1", text: "How likely are you...?" })
   ```
5. **Result**: Two new questions are created, and their IDs are returned.
   ```
   { question: "q1" }
   { question: "q2" }
   ```
6. **Action**: The respondent submits their answers to both questions.
   ```
   LikertSurvey.submitResponse({ respondent: "respondentB", question: "q1", value: 5 })
   LikertSurvey.submitResponse({ respondent: "respondentB", question: "q2", value: 4 })
   ```
7. **Result**: The responses are successfully recorded.
   ```
   {}
   {}
   ```
8. **Action**: The author queries for all responses to their survey to analyze the results.
   ```
   LikertSurvey._getSurveyResponses({ survey: "survey1" })
   ```
9. **Result**: The state reflects the submitted responses, fulfilling the concept's purpose.
   ```
   [
     { _id: ..., respondent: "respondentB", question: "q1", value: 5 },
     { _id: ..., respondent: "respondentB", question: "q2", value: 4 }
   ]
   ```

You are an expert technical writer and TypeScript developer.

I have a test file `courseSchedulingConcept.test.ts`. The **actual test output** from running this file is stored in a variable called `TestingOutput`.

I also have a reference Markdown document called `Testing.md` that documents test results in a **specific format**. The style, headings, and layout of `Testing.md` must be followed exactly.

Your task:

1. Create a **new Markdown document** based on the `TestingOutput`.

2. Format it **exactly like `Testing.md`**, using the same structure, headings, bullet points, and style.

3. Include all test results with information about the principle given, action, and result as seen in Testing.md

4. Make it ready-to-use as a documentation file that mirrors `Testing.md` but reflects the actual results from `TestingOutput`.

Do not change the style or structure from `Testing.md`; the only difference should be the test data coming from `TestingOutput`.
