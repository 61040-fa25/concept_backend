# prompt:

This is how you implement a concept:
[@implementing-concepts.md](../../design/background/implementing-concepts.md)

Please implement the following concept in typescript using the background information above:
[@passwordAuth.md](../../design/specificConceptSpecs/passwordAuth.md)

This is what you have so far implemented.  However, the imports don't make sense because there aren't any infrustructure files.  I don't want you to create any new infrustructure files, and simply implement the concept that I have specified above.
[@](../../src/concepts/Scriblink/passwordAuth.ts)
