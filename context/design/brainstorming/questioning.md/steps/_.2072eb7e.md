# Mirror Motion Backend

This repository contains the backend implementation for Mirror Motion, a project designed to help users manage their videos and receive AI-generated feedback on their practice choreography. The backend is built using TypeScript with Deno and utilizes MongoDB for data storage.

## Project Concepts

The core of this backend is structured around several concepts:

* **UserConcept**: Manages user registration, login, and secure access to their own video content. Its purpose is to let users securely manage and access their own videos.
* **FeedbackConcept**: Compares practice video pose data against reference choreography to generate textual feedback and an accuracy score. Its purpose is to highlight differences between practice video and reference choreography.
* **ManageVideoConcept** (Assumed/Upcoming): This concept is responsible for handling video uploads, storage, and retrieval, providing the `Video` entities referenced by the `FeedbackConcept`.
