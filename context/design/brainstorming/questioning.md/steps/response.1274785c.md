# response:

To implement the `PasswordAuth` concept in TypeScript, adhering to the principles outlined in `implementing-concepts.md` and the *implied* specifications for password authentication (as the prompt's example solution refers to `passwordAuth.md` despite the `@concept.md` pointing to `folder.md`), we will follow these steps:

1. **Define an `IPasswordAuth` interface:** This sets the contract for password operations (hashing and verification), fulfilling the "Interface/Contract" principle.
2. **Create a `PasswordAuthConfig` interface:** To allow configuration of the underlying hashing mechanism (e.g., `saltRounds` for bcrypt).
3. **Implement a concrete `BcryptPasswordAuth` class:** This class will implement `IPasswordAuth` using the `bcryptjs` library for secure hashing, providing a "Concrete Implementation".
4. **Provide a `createPasswordAuth` factory function:** This function will create and return an instance of `IPasswordAuth`, abstracting away the concrete implementation and its configuration details, adhering to the "Factory Function" principle.
5. **Ensure Simplicity and Dependency Management:** The implementation will focus solely on password hashing/verification, encapsulating the `bcryptjs` dependency.
6. **Include an example usage block:** To demonstrate how to use the implemented concept.

All code will be contained within a single TypeScript file, as requested.

***

**Important Note on Concept Specification:**
The prompt points to `[@concept.md](../../design/specificConceptSpecs/folder.md)`. However, the provided example response structure *explicitly mentions and implements* a `PasswordAuth` concept from `passwordAuth.md`. Given this contradiction, and to provide a coherent and useful implementation as demonstrated by the prompt's implied intent, this response will implement the **`PasswordAuth` concept** as described in the introductory paragraph.

**Prerequisites:**

For this implementation, we will use the `bcryptjs` library for password hashing. If you plan to run this code, you'll need to install it:

```bash
npm install bcryptjs @types/bcryptjs
```

***

Here is the TypeScript implementation:

```typescript
// passwordAuth.ts

// --- Background Information: Implementing Concepts ---
// (Based on ../../design/background/implementing-concepts.md)
// Key principles applied:
// 1.  **Define an Interface/Contract**: The `IPasswordAuth` interface specifies *what* password operations are supported, decoupling from *how* they are implemented.
// 2.  **Provide Concrete Implementation(s)**: `BcryptPasswordAuth` implements `IPasswordAuth` using a specific technology (`bcryptjs`).
// 3.  **Offer a Factory Function**: `createPasswordAuth` provides a simple, abstract way to instantiate the concept, hiding the concrete class.
// 4.  **Keep it Simple**: The concept focuses purely on hashing and verification, avoiding scope creep.
// 5.  **Manage Dependencies**: The `bcryptjs` library is encapsulated within the `BcryptPasswordAuth` class.

// --- Concept Specification: PasswordAuth ---
// (Based on the implied `passwordAuth` concept, as per the provided example's description)
// The `PasswordAuth` concept is responsible for securely handling password operations. It provides:
// -   `hashPassword(password: string): Promise<string>`: To securely hash a plain-text password (asynchronously).
// -   `verifyPassword(password: string, hashedPassword: string): Promise<boolean>`: To compare a plain-text password against a stored hash (asynchronously).

// --- Implementation ---

// Import the bcryptjs library for secure password hashing.
// Ensure you have installed it: `npm install bcryptjs @types/bcryptjs`
import * as bcrypt from 'bcryptjs';
