# prompt:

Implement deleteFolder and insertItem.   InsertItem inserts into the element list. Use the same types that I do:

**Folder\[Item, User]**

* **Purpose:** Organize items hierarchically
* **Principle:** After you create a folder and insert elements into it, you can move the folder into another folder and all the elements still belong to it.  You can insert folders or items inside a folder.
* **State:**
  * Set of Folders with
    * title String
    * an owner User
    * a contained set of Folders
    * an elements set of `Item`
* **Actions:**
  * `initializeFolders(u: User): (f: Folder)`
    * **requires** the user `u` has created no other folders
    * **effect** creates a root folder to nest elements and folders inside of that the user owns
  * `createFolder(u: User, title: String, parent: Folder): (f: Folder)`
    * **requires** `parent` exists and has owner `u`
    * **effect** creates a folder with title `title` that is a child of the folder `parent`
  * `moveFolder(f1: Folder, f2: Folder)`
    * **requires** f2 is not hierarchcly a descendent of f1.  In other words, f2 cannot be inside of f1 through any path of folders.  Both folders must have the same owner.
    * **effect** if f1 is already in a folder, remove it from that folder and move it into f2.  If f1 is a new folder, just add it to f2.
  * `deleteFolder(f: Folder)`
    * **effect** deletes f and everything contained inside of f from the folder hierarchy
  * `insertItem(i: Item, f: Folder)`
    * **effect** if i is already in a folder, remove it from that folder and insert it into f.  Otherwise, simply insert it into f

Current code:
"  import { Collection, Db } from "npm:mongodb";
import { Empty, ID } from "@utils/types.ts";
import { freshID } from "@utils/database.ts";

// Collection prefix to ensure namespace separation
const PREFIX = "Scriblink" + ".";

// Generic types for the concept's external dependencies
type User = ID;
type Item = ID;

// Internal entity types, represented as IDs
type Folder = ID;
