# response:

That's another great question that gets to the heart of data lifecycle management. You're thinking about how users will manage their data sources, which is critical.

You've hit on a key point: a general "delete all" action is often less useful and more dangerous than the targeted "delete by origin" approach.

Let's break down the reasoning.

### Comparison of the Two Approaches

| Approach          | **Delete by "Origin"**                                                                                                                                            | **Delete All Busy Slots**                                                                                                                                     |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **User Intent**   | "I want to disconnect my Google Calendar from this app."                                                                                                          | "I want to wipe my entire schedule clean."                                                                                                                    |
| **Precision**     | **High.** It only removes data from a specific, known source, leaving the user's manually-entered data untouched.                                                 | **Low.** It's a "blunt instrument" that erases everything, including potentially valuable native tasks the user created.                                      |
| **Safety**        | **High.** It's very difficult for a user to accidentally delete data they wanted to keep. The scope is limited and predictable.                                   | **Low.** This is a highly destructive action. A single accidental click could cause significant, irreversible data loss and user frustration.                 |
| **Sync Use Case** | **Essential.** This is the *exact* function needed when a user revokes access or you want to "refresh" a single calendar. It's a core part of the sync lifecycle. | **Not a sync function.** This is more of a "reset account" or "nuke data" feature. It doesn't help with the ongoing management of a specific external source. |

### Conclusion and Recommendation

For the core functionality of syncing, a **"delete by origin" action is superior and necessary.** A "delete all" function is more of an administrative, high-risk tool that serves a completely different, and much less common, purpose.

There is very little reason to have a "delete all" function *as part of the sync logic*. However, you might have a "Clear All Schedule Data" button hidden deep in the app's settings page, behind several confirmation dialogs, for users who truly want to start over.

Let's model the more precise and useful action. We can call it `disconnectExternalCalendar`.

Here is the revised `Schedule` concept with this new action.

concept Schedule
purpose to organize and display a user's time-based commitments from both manual entries and external sources
principle all items, regardless of source, are presented in a unified chronological view. Items from external sources are read-only.

a title String
a startTime DateTime

an origin: (NATIVE, EXTERNAL)
an externalCalendarId String? # optional: identifies the source calendar if origin is EXTERNAL
an externalEventId String? # optional: the unique ID of the event in the source calendar
a isReadOnly Boolean # true if origin is EXTERNAL
