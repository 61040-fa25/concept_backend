# prompt test courseScheduling following example given in LikertSurveyConcept.test.ts and finding CourseSheduling concept in courseSchedulingConcept.ts

You are an expert TypeScript developer and testing engineer.

I have a file `courseSchedulingConcept.ts` that exports several asynchronous actions (functions) which interact with a database. The file uses TypeScript interfaces for `Course`, `Section`, and `CourseSchedulingState`.

I also have a reference test file, `LikertSurveyConcept.test.ts`, which shows the exact structure, style, and conventions I want to replicate:

* Using Denoâ€™s `std/testing/asserts.ts` for assertions (`assert`, `assertEquals`, `assertExists`)

* Using stubs, spies, and mocks for database calls

* Structuring tests in isolated `Deno.test` blocks

Your task: Generate a **complete test file** called `courseSchedulingConcept.test.ts` that implements unit tests for **all actions exported from `courseSchedulingConcept.ts`**.

Requirements:

1. Follow the **same style and structure** as `LikertSurveyConcept.test.ts`.

2. Ensure each action is tested with proper mocking of the database (`db.collection` calls).

3. Respect the TypeScript interfaces (`Course`, `Section`, `CourseSchedulingState`) so that the tests type-check correctly.

4. Include tests for normal behavior, edge cases, and error handling where applicable.

5. Make each test independent and idempotent (state reset for each test).

Output a ready-to-use TypeScript test file that can be placed alongside `courseSchedulingConcept.ts`.
