# response:

To write a "Concept Design" using an LLM, you need to provide the LLM with a clear understanding of what a "concept" is according to your definition, and then guide it through the structured creation of a specific concept.

The key is to leverage the LLM's ability to understand context, generate structured text, and follow instructions.

Here's a step-by-step guide and a detailed prompt structure:

***

## Guide for Writing a Concept using an LLM

### Step 1: Provide the LLM with the Definition

**Crucial First Step:** Copy and paste the entire "Why Concept Design?" text you provided into your LLM prompt. This grounds the LLM in your specific terminology and principles.

```
[PASTE THE ENTIRE TEXT YOU PROVIDED ABOVE HERE]

---

Now, acting as an expert "Concept Designer" following these principles, I need you to help me define a new concept.
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Concept and Provide Initial Ideas

Think about what specific functionality you want to encapsulate. Give the LLM a high-level idea.

**Example Ideas:**

* "A way for users to create and manage personal to-do lists."
* "A system for tracking friend relationships between users."
* "A concept for managing events and attendee RSVPs."

### Step 3: Use a Structured Prompt Template

This template guides the LLM to generate all the necessary components of a concept, adhering to the principles outlined in your text.

```
Please define the following concept, ensuring it strictly adheres to the principles of Concept Design described above, especially regarding independence, completeness, and state definition.

**Concept Idea:** [Your high-level idea here, e.g., "A way for users to create and manage personal to-do lists."]

---

**1. Concept Name:**
   *   What is a concise, clear name for this concept? (e.g., `Upvote`, `RestaurantReservation`)

**2. Purpose and Motivation:**
   *   Describe the core purpose and value this concept delivers to users. Why does it exist?

**3. Concept State:**
   *   List the different *kinds of objects* this concept maintains in its state (e.g., `Item`, `User` for Upvote).
   *   For each object kind, describe the *properties* it has *within this concept's scope*. Remember: "sufficiently rich but no richer than it need be." Do not include properties that don't directly support this concept's behavior.
   *   Describe the *relationships* between these objects that this concept maintains.

**4. Atomic Actions:**
   *   List the user-facing atomic actions this concept supports. For each action:
      *   **Action Name:** (e.g., `reserve`, `cancel`)
      *   **Type:** (Input/Output - i.e., user-initiated vs. spontaneous)
      *   **Arguments:** What inputs does it take? (Refer to object kinds defined in state)
      *   **Description:** What does this action do? What are its effects on the concept's state? What rules does it enforce?

**5. Human Behavioral Protocol:**
   *   How would a human user describe their interaction with this concept? What pattern of behavior does it enable? (e.g., "reserving, perhaps canceling, being seated on arrival")

**6. Independence and Completeness (Self-Correction/Exclusions):**
   *   Explicitly state what functionality or data *this concept does NOT include* and *why* (i.e., how it maintains its independence from other potential concepts and ensures completeness within its own domain). How does it avoid relying on "making calls" to other concepts?
   *   Confirm that it does not reference other concepts directly.

**7. Polymorphism Considerations:**
   *   How is this concept designed to be as general and reusable as possible?
   *   How does it avoid making assumptions about the content/interpretation of objects passed as arguments? (e.g., applying comments to *arbitrary targets*).

```

### Step 4: Iterate and Refine with the LLM

Once the LLM generates its first attempt, review it critically against the principles in your original text. Don't hesitate to ask follow-up questions or request revisions:

* "Could you elaborate on how the `[Action Name]` prevents `[specific problem]`?"
* "I think `[Property]` is too much information for this concept. Could you remove it and explain why it's not needed?"
* "The `[Action Name]` seems to imply a dependency on `[Another Concept]`. How can we refactor it to ensure completeness within *this* concept?"
* "Is the `[Object]` definition sufficiently polymorphic? How could it be more general?"
* "Can you give an example of a `sync` that would involve this concept and another related concept like `UserAuthentication`?" (This tests its understanding of how concepts interact *externally*.)

**LLM's Generated Response (example):**

```
Here is a definition for the `ToDoList` concept, designed according to your principles:

**1. Concept Name:** `ToDoList`

**2. Purpose and Motivation:**
   The `ToDoList` concept's core purpose is to enable users to organize and track tasks they need to accomplish. It provides value by helping users manage their personal commitments, prioritize work, and gain a sense of achievement by marking tasks as complete.

**3. Concept State:**
   *   **Object Kinds:**
      *   `User`: Represents an individual user who owns one or more to-do lists.
         *   *Properties:* `userId` (a unique identifier for the user within this concept).
      *   `List`: Represents a collection of tasks.
         *   *Properties:* `listId` (unique identifier), `ownerId` (references a `userId` in this concept), `name` (e.g., "Work Tasks," "Groceries").
      *   `Task`: Represents a single item on a to-do list.
         *   *Properties:* `taskId` (unique identifier), `listId` (references a `listId` in this concept), `description` (text of the task), `isCompleted` (boolean, true if completed, false otherwise), `dueDate` (optional date for task completion).

   *   **Relationships:**
      *   A `User` can own multiple `List`s.
      *   A `List` is owned by exactly one `User`.
      *   A `List` contains multiple `Task`s.
      *   A `Task` belongs to exactly one `List`.

**4. Atomic Actions:**

   *   **Action Name:** `createList`
      *   **Type:** Input
      *   **Arguments:** `ownerId` (identifier for the user creating the list), `listName` (string for the list's title).
      *   **Description:** Creates a new empty `List` owned by the specified user with the given name.

   *   **Action Name:** `deleteList`
      *   **Type:** Input
      *   **Arguments:** `listId` (identifier of the list to delete), `requesterId` (identifier of the user attempting to delete).
      *   **Description:** Deletes a specified `List` and all `Task`s within it. Only the `ownerId` of the list can perform this action.

   *   **Action Name:** `renameList`
      *   **Type:** Input
      *   **Arguments:** `listId`, `newName`, `requesterId`.
      *   **Description:** Renames the specified `List`. Only the `ownerId` can perform this.

   *   **Action Name:** `addTask`
      *   **Type:** Input
      *   **Arguments:** `listId`, `taskDescription` (string), `dueDate` (optional date), `requesterId`.
      *   **Description:** Adds a new `Task` to the specified `List` with the given description and optional due date. Only the `ownerId` of the list can add tasks.

   *   **Action Name:** `markTaskCompleted`
      *   **Type:** Input
      *   **Arguments:** `taskId`, `requesterId`.
      *   **Description:** Changes the `isCompleted` status of a specific `Task` to `true`. Only the `ownerId` of the task's list can perform this.

   *   **Action Name:** `markTaskIncomplete`
      *   **Type:** Input
      *   **Arguments:** `taskId`, `requesterId`.
      *   **Description:** Changes the `isCompleted` status of a specific `Task` to `false`. Only the `ownerId` of the task's list can perform this.

   *   **Action Name:** `deleteTask`
      *   **Type:** Input
      *   **Arguments:** `taskId`, `requesterId`.
      *   **Description:** Removes a specific `Task` from its `List`. Only the `ownerId` of the task's list can perform this.

**5. Human Behavioral Protocol:**
   A user would interact with the `ToDoList` concept by: creating lists for different categories (e.g., "Work," "Personal," "Shopping"), adding individual tasks to those lists, marking tasks as done when completed, and optionally setting or updating due dates. They can also rename or delete entire lists or individual tasks. It's a structured way of keeping track of "what I need to do."

**6. Independence and Completeness (Self-Correction/Exclusions):**
   This `ToDoList` concept **does not include**:
   *   **User authentication or profiles:** It only stores `userId` as an opaque identifier. Details like username, password, email, profile picture, etc., are handled by separate concepts like `UserAuthentication` or `UserProfile`. The `ToDoList` concept assumes that a valid `userId` is provided and doesn't validate it beyond its existence in its own state.
   *   **Notifications:** It does not send email or push notifications when a due date is approaching or a task is completed. Such functionality would belong to a separate `Notification` concept, which could be synchronized with `ToDoList` (e.g., `when ToDoList.taskDueDateApproaches (t) then Notification.sendReminder(t.ownerId, t.description)`).
   *   **Sharing lists:** The concept is designed for personal lists. Sharing capabilities would introduce complexities and relationships with other users that belong in a separate `ListSharing` concept.
   *   **Complex project management features:** Such as task dependencies, sub-tasks, or collaboration roles, which would necessitate a `ProjectManagement` or `TaskDependency` concept.

   The `ToDoList` concept is complete because it fully manages the lifecycle of tasks and lists within its domain without needing to call actions of other services to fulfill its core functionality. Its internal state and actions are sufficient for its defined purpose. It refers to `userId` as an identifier, but doesn't "know" anything else about the user beyond that.

**7. Polymorphism Considerations:**
   The `ToDoList` concept is highly polymorphic.
   *   `userId` is treated as a generic identifier, allowing any system that can provide a unique user reference to integrate. It doesn't assume any structure for `userId` (e.g., it could be an integer, UUID, or string).
   *   `taskDescription` is a simple string, allowing for any kind of task content without interpretation by the concept.
   *   `dueDate` is a generic date/time stamp, making no assumptions about specific calendar systems or time zones, leaving that to presentation layers or other concepts.
   This allows the `ToDoList` concept to be reused across diverse applications without modification to its core logic, regardless of how users or specific task details are represented elsewhere.
