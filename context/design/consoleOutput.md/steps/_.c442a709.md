  ✅ Technical text summary: \*   **Core Concept:** Machine learning empowers computers to learn from data and make decisions.
* **Learning Approaches:** Three main types: supervised (labeled data), unsupervised (pattern discovery), and reinforcement (rewards/penalties).
* **Common Algorithms:** Techniques like regression, decision trees, and neural networks are widely used.
* **Key Applications:** Image recognition, language processing, and self-driving cars are prominent examples.
* **Challenges to Overcome:** Overfitting, data bias, and the necessity of extensive training data.
