# response:

You're absolutely right to push for representation independence in testing! Tests should interact with the concept *only* through its defined actions and queries, treating it as a black box that adheres to its specification.

To achieve this, we need to make a few precise adjustments:

1. **Clarify `Notification` type in `NotificationConcept.ts`:** The concept spec uses `Notification` in two contexts:
   * As an ID (e.g., `createNotification` returns `(notification: Notification)`, `deleteNotification` takes `(notification: Notification)`).
   * As a full data structure (e.g., `a set of Notification with...`, `_getAllNotifications` returns `(notifications: Notification[])` with the effect "returns a list of all notifications").
     To resolve this ambiguity and ensure type safety/clarity:
   * We'll define `export type NotificationID = ID;` for when we refer to just the ID of a notification.
   * We'll use `interface Notification { ... }` (singular, as requested) for the full document structure.
   * The `createdAt` field will be added to the `Notification` interface, as it's implicitly required by the `_getAllNotifications` query's sorting requirement.
   * Action parameters and return types will be updated accordingly.

2. **Implement `_getAllNotifications` in `NotificationConcept.ts`:** This query was missing from the last iteration and is crucial for external verification. It will return an array of dictionaries, each containing a `notifications` field which holds an array of full `Notification` objects.

3. **Refactor `NotificationConcept.test.ts`:**
   * Import `NotificationConcept` and `NotificationID` (the ID type) from the concept file.
   * **Remove all direct access to `concept.notifications.findOne()` or `concept.notifications.find().toArray()` calls.**
   * Instead, use the `_getAllNotifications` query to fetch notifications for verification.
   * Update assertions to correctly parse the return structure of `_getAllNotifications`.
