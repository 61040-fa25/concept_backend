\--- Principle Trace: Remind users to save and celebrate milestones ---

**Goal:** Demonstrate that the Notification concept can be used to send reminders for savings plans and celebrate milestones, as per its purpose and principle.

**Scenario:** User Alice has a savings plan and progresses through it. We want to send her regular reminders and a one-time celebration message upon reaching a milestone.

1. **Initial State:** The `Notification.notifications` collection is empty.
   * `concept.notifications.countDocuments({})` == `0`

2. **Action: Set up Alice's Savings Plan (Conceptual)**
   * An external system (e.g., a `SavingsPlan` concept not defined here) establishes that `USER_ALICE` has a savings plan identified by `PROGRESS_TRACKING_SAVINGS`.
   * No direct `Notification` action, but this sets the context.

3. **Action: Create a Weekly Savings Reminder Notification**
   * **Call:** `concept.createNotification({ user: USER_ALICE, progress: PROGRESS_TRACKING_SAVINGS, frequency: 7, message: "Don't forget to track your weekly savings for your holiday fund!" })`
   * **Expected Return:** `{ notification: "notification:..." }`
   * **Effect:** A new notification document `N1` is created in the `notifications` collection with:
     * `_id`: `N1_ID` (freshly generated ID)
     * `user`: `USER_ALICE`
     * `progress`: `PROGRESS_TRACKING_SAVINGS`
     * `frequency`: `7`
     * `message`: "Don't forget to track your weekly savings for your holiday fund!"
   * **Verification:**
     * The `createNotification` call returns `N1_ID`.
     * Querying the database for `N1_ID` confirms its existence and correct details.
     * `concept.notifications.findOne({ _id: N1_ID })` returns `N1`.

4. **Action: Create a Milestone Celebration Notification**
   * **Call:** `concept.createNotification({ user: USER_ALICE, progress: PROGRESS_TRACKING_SAVINGS, frequency: 0, message: "Congratulations, Alice! You've reached 50% of your savings goal!" })`
   * **Expected Return:** `{ notification: "notification:..." }`
   * **Effect:** A new notification document `N2` is created in the `notifications` collection with:
     * `_id`: `N2_ID` (freshly generated ID)
     * `user`: `USER_ALICE`
     * `progress`: `PROGRESS_TRACKING_SAVINGS`
     * `frequency`: `0` (or similar indicator for one-time)
     * `message`: "Congratulations, Alice! You've reached 50% of your savings goal!"
   * **Verification:**
     * The `createNotification` call returns `N2_ID`.
     * Querying the database for `N2_ID` confirms its existence and correct details.
     * `concept.notifications.findOne({ _id: N2_ID })` returns `N2`.

5. **Verification: Alice Views Her Notifications (Simulated)**
   * **Simulated Query (Direct DB check in test):** `concept.notifications.find({ user: USER_ALICE }).toArray()`
   * **Expected Result:** An array containing `N1` and `N2`.
   * **Confirmation:** Alice has 2 notifications, representing both the reminder and the celebration.

6. **Action: Delete the Weekly Reminder Notification**
   * **Call:** `concept.deleteNotification({ user: USER_ALICE, notification: N1_ID })`
   * **Requires:** Notification `N1_ID` exists and belongs to `USER_ALICE`. (This is met).
   * **Expected Return:** `{}`
   * **Effect:** The notification document `N1` is removed from the `notifications` collection.
   * **Verification:**
     * The `deleteNotification` call returns an empty object `{}`.
     * `concept.notifications.findOne({ _id: N1_ID })` returns `null`.

7. **Final State Verification:**
   * **Simulated Query (Direct DB check in test):** `concept.notifications.find({ user: USER_ALICE }).toArray()`
   * **Expected Result:** An array containing only `N2`.
   * **Confirmation:** Alice now has only 1 notification (the celebration message), and the reminder is gone.

This trace demonstrates how the `createNotification` action is used to fulfill the principle of sending reminders and how `deleteNotification` allows for managing these notifications.
