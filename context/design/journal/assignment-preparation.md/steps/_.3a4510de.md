# Tasks Breakdown

#### Tasks

* \[x] Template repo
  * \[x] Finish Prep
  * \[x] Be familiar with ctx tool/workflow
    * `./ctx prompt design/path/file.md` to run a prompt, with the prompt in an H1
    * Each file must start with an H1
* \[ ] Rework/improve Concepts
  * \[ ] Assess individual concepts for flaws, including:
    * Non-comprehensive action sets
    * Poorly defined state types
    * Dependency on another concept's state or actions
    * Conflated concerns between concepts
  * \[ ] Document any concept changes/issues in \[concept]-design.md
  * \[ ] Assess application/syncs for flaws, including:
    * Feasibility of the system
    * Missing necessary syncs
  * \[ ] Document any resulting concept changes in \[concept]-design.md
  * \[ ] Document any application-wide changes in application-design.md
* \[ ] Covert Concepts into Concept Specifications
* \[ ] Implement concept backend
  * AI slop them into existence, as instructed
* \[ ] Develop tests for each concept
  * \[ ] Operational principle test
  * \[ ] 3-5 interesting scenarios, with each action hit at least once
* \[ ] Regular iteration over implementation + tests until tests are good and pass
