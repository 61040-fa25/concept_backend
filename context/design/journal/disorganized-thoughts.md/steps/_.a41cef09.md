# Thoughts while working on the assignment

* Where the heck is everything? "a specification file (in markdown, using our structured specification notation);" WHERE IS THE STRUCTURED SPECIFICATION NOTATION???
  * Answer: There is an [example in Assignment-3](design/background/examples/specification-notation)
* Wow, it's going to take forever to manually `ctx save` every single file I may want to mention
* I feel like I'm spending a lot of overhead time just trying to figure out a good workflow to use the ctx tool
