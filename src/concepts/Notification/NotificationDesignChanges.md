I refactored this concept to narrow its surface area and make the behavior and responsibilities explicit without changing the core idea. Previously the concept attempted to cover a broader set of notification behaviors (repetition rules, complex scheduling, and multiple delivery channels); for the scope of this project I intentionally reduced that complexity so the concept fits a single, well-scoped use case: a coach composes a short digest of one or more events, schedules it (or sends immediately), and the system delivers that digest by email to the listed recipients. The refactor clarifies the state (what a Notification stores) and the minimal action contract (create, addEvent, send), and it documents error modes and important operational constraints such as email addresses must be present and Gmail/OAuth requirements for sending on behalf of a coach. This makes the implementation simpler and the testing surface more tractable while preserving the intended user experience: coaches still pick events, add an optional message, and push a send button to notify their team. If additional features are needed later (retries, recurring schedules, push notifications, or richer templates), they can be layered on top of this focused core without changing how the primary flows work.
